{"prompt": "Write an analytical piece about my view on india in the current environment", "answer": "My view on India in the current environment\n\nIndia is trying to play the middle ground by remaining close to Russia, while not dissing the US completely. There are good reasons for this stance especially given the close past relationship with Russia plus its dependence on Russian arms and ability to get oil at reduced rates. On the other hand, India and the US share China as their primary adversary and the US is India\u2019s largest investment and trading partner so it makes sense to remain connected to the US.\n\nThis middle path might have worked in normal times, but I am of the view that we are on the cusp of a new and more polarized world order where everyone is going to have to choose sides. India can try to create a new \u201cnon-aligned\u201d bloc but given how poorly it worked out the last time (Nehru\u2019s folly) it makes little sense to sit on the fence. And the threat from China far more acute, given their military and economic superiority over India coupled with a burning desire to achieve \u201cglobal domination by 2049\u201d \u2013 the 100th anniversary of the Chinese communist party.\n\nIn any event, the way things are playing out, it is highly likely that Russia will end up as a vassal state of China, completely dependent on China to buy their energy and minerals, while getting all its technology, machinery and even consumer goods from them. In this situation, I don\u2019t believe the Chinese will be thrilled with the Russians selling arms to India or doing India any favors. In this new world order, India will get the short end of the stick by allying with the new Russia/China/Pakistan axis.\n\nThe only way for India to meaningfully resist the Chinese, both economically and militarily, is to partner with the Quad (India, US, Australia and Japan) all of whom have their own reasons to take on China in a meaningful way.", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

{"prompt": "Write an analytical piece about min var paper", "answer": "FROM Barra NEWSLETTER JULY/AUGUST 1993 \nAre Emerging Markets too Risky for You? \n Buy more and reduce risk!\n BY ARJUN DIVECHA \nEveryone knows that investing in emerging markets i s risky.  That's only true, however, if you put a la rge proportion of your money in emerging markets.  I n the paper entitled \"Emerging \nMarkets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well-diversified emerging markets p ortfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overal l volatility of a global investor's \nportfolio over the past five years.  In this article  we propose a methodology to further reduce the ris k of a global portfolio--through increased investme nts in emerging markets!\n Modest investments in emerging markets actually red uce risk \nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets inde x fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a gl obal portfolio (FT World Index) over the period Jan uary, 1988 to \nDecember, 1992.\n We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging  markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years)\nfrom 7.69% to just over 10%.  In fact, investments o f up to 50% in the emerging markets would have redu ced risk and increased return relative to the FT Wo rld Index.  This risk reduction \n(and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years--it is true for any five yea r (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index  was created).\n This analysis assumes that the investor buys an eme rging markets index fund; that is, weights countrie s in proportion to their market capitalization.  The  results are likely to be true for any \nwell-diversified emerging markets portfolio.  Puttin g all of one's emerging markets assets into one reg ion, such as Latin America, would not result in a w ell-diversified portfolio.  Lacking any \nother information, how should one allocate money to  different countries or regions?  Is indexation, usi ng market capitalization weights, the right answer?\n Capitalization weighting requires heroic assumption s \nThe case for weighting countries according to their  market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets.  To weight countries in propo rtion to their market capitalization,\none has to assume that markets are efficiently pric ed.  If markets are not efficiently priced, market w eighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" count ries (such as Japan in the late 1980s)\nand underweight \"undervalued\" countries .\n In the emerging markets, where there are severe res trictions on what global investors can buy within e ach market, market weighting makes little sense, si nce the definition of what\nconstitutes the market capitalization depends on wh o you are (local or foreigner) and what is availabl e for you to buy.  Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two \nmonths and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan  did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficien t.\n In such bipolar markets, would one use the total ma rket capitalization (available to the locals) or ju st the float available to foreigners to determine e ach country's weight?  These two methods \nlead to radically different weights for countries s uch as Korea, Taiwan, and India.  Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC I nvestable Index (as of June 1,\n1993).  The difference between the two indices is th at the IFC Global index uses total market capitaliz ation while the IFC Investable index uses the float  that is available to global investors.\n If market capitalization weighting doesn't make any  sense in the emerging markets, what does?  One prop osed solution is to use GDP weights.  The World Bank , however, has recently \nredefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rat es.  This causes the emerging markets (as a group) t o go from about 20% of world http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx \n1 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AMGDP to just under 50%.

{"prompt": "Discuss min var paper with data-driven insights", "answer": "Using this new definition of  GDP weighting would require global investors to im mediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the \nemerging markets.  In short, using GDP weights now r equires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchan ge rates).  The choices \nthey make would cause huge differences in relative weights.  Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\n If not market or GDP weights, then what? \n Another proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting.  The concept is simple and well-unde rstood because of its relevance in the U.S.  equity market.  We pick the weights of\neach country that would create a minimum-variance p ortfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire curr ency.  Thus, each country's weight is based on the a mount it contributed to lowering \nthe risk of the overall portfolio instead of its ma rket capitalization.  Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation w ith other markets would have the highest\nweight, and those with high predicted volatility or  high correlation with other countries would have t he lowest weight.\n The theoretical basis for such a low-volatility str ategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be clos e to the efficient frontier.  One can forecast volat ility with considerable accuracy; thus, a \nportfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex post.  If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can  be reasonably sure that the ex ante LV \nportfolio will be close to the ex post minimum-variance point, even if we know nothing abo ut what its return might be.  On the other hand, one  can make no such assertion about market-\nweighted portfolios.  One can only discover ex post whether they were close to the frontier or not.  As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mea n variance (MV) efficient than the \nmarket portfolio.\n Thus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to hav e lower volatility than the market portfolio, we ha ve no ex ante forecast of the relative return of one vis-a-vis th e other.  If in fact the \nmarket portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it  is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio w ill be as high as, or higher than, the market\nportfolio.  Numerous researchers 2 have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S.  market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subjec t of two earlier newsletter articles.3 Their work \nindicates that in the U.S.  market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\n This weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose i mage is synonymous with high risk),\nand having the possibility of doing at least as wel l as the market portfolio (if the U.S.  precedent ho lds).\n Such a methodology, without any constraints on the weights of each country, results in weights that ar e either unpalatable or uninvestable, from a global  investor's point of view.  As with \nany unconstrained optimization, one needs to be war y that the volatility minimization process does not  lead to error maximization.  It makes sense to set constraints on country weights based \non the true investability of each country and the \" prudent person\" test (for example, no matter how go od India may seem to the optimizer, no prudent pers on would put 80% of their money \nthere).\n A nice idea, but does it work? \n We tested out this idea to see how it would have wo rked over the past five years.  To make this a reali stic strategy, we used a simple constraint: that ea ch country's weight had to range from \n50% to 200% of its market capitalization weight.  Th is ensures that each country will have a weight tha t is reasonable and investable for the global inves tor. ", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

{"prompt": "Provide a thoughtful analysis of min var paper", "answer": "We chose the numbers, 50% and \n200%, quite arbitrarily; for an actual investment t he range should probably be tailored to the investa bility of each country and the risk aversion of the  investor.\n We used the following methodology to construct the portfolios:\n1) We chose from all the countries in the IFC Globa l Composite Index except for Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Jor dan, Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, and Indonesia.  We deemed all of these \n(except for Indonesia for which adequate data was n ot available) to be uninvestable and/or uninteresti ng to the global investor.\n 2) We used the monthly total return, in U.S.  dollar s, to each market from January, 1985 to December, 1 987 (36 months) to form the first variance-covarian ce matrix.

The LV portf olio did indeed have lower volatility than the IFC index, as expected.  The finding that the LV portfol io outperformed the IFC \nindex over the same time period is somewhat surpris ing.  This would imply that the IFC index was almost  certainly not MV efficient over this period--a fur ther nail in the capitalization-\nweighting coffin.http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx \n3 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AMWe find that the realized volatility (annualized st andard deviation of monthly returns) of the LV port folio over this five-year period was 16.54%, compar ed to 23.39% for the IFC index.\n Exhibit 3 shows the 24-month rolling volatility over this t ime period; clearly, the LV portfolio had lower rea lized volatility than the IFC index over the entire  time span.\n The results show that such an LV strategy would ind eed have worked over the past five years.  In our op inion, one can make a strong case for viewing the L V weights as the baseline for\nperformance evaluation.\n More is better \nThe analysis thus far has focused on how to weight the emerging markets among themselves.  Now let's ex amine the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a gl obal investor's portfolio.http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx \n4 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AMExhibit 4 shows the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a global portfolio.  The choice of capitalization weig hts or LV weights doesn't seem to make much differe nce up to weights of 10% \nin the emerging markets, but the impact is quite dr amatic after that.  The strategy clearly leads to mu ch greater risk reduction than the capitalization-w eighted IFC Index.\n Additionally, whereas the lowest volatility of the IFC-FT mix is at approximately a 20% level of inves tment in emerging markets, the lowest risk point of  the LV-FT mix is with an \ninvestment of between 40-50% in the emerging market s.  Thus, using this methodology strengthens an alre ady strong case for investments in the emerging mar kets.\n But wait, there's more... \n Still further risk reduction is possible.  The curre nt optimization computed country weights for the LV  portfolio based on minimizing risk within the emer ging markets, and I then used the \nLV portfolio as a single asset when combined with t he world portfolio.  Even further risk reductions wo uld have resulted if the optimization to pick count ry weights had taken into account\nthe investor's existing mix of countries and asset classes.\n The early bird gets the worm \nThis significant risk reduction occurs primarily be cause emerging markets are uncorrelated to each oth er and to developed markets.
