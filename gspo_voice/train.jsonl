In both cases the bubble was caused by overcapacity financed with \u201ccheap\u201d capital, overvalued markets encouraged by accommodating central bankers and overpriced currencies driven by massive foreign direct and portfolio investment.\n\nWhile the Asia crisis has largely played out, we are in the early stages of the unraveling of the U.S. bubble.

{"prompt": "Write an analytical piece about india", "answer": "Emerging Thoughts: Policy Paralysis in India\n\nIndia is grinding to a halt. Well, not all of India, but an important part of it which depends on government policy action. The reason is the exposure of corruption and scandals associated with government officials taking bribes. \nCorruption has been endemic in India since the time of independence in 1947 (and maybe well before that as well). What\u2019s different this time is that the media have been exposing this corruption and on the back of these revelations important people (more specifically senior politicians and billionaires) are being put in jail and are being kept there, with judges refusing to grant them bail. \nIn the past, these same people would give and take bribes with impunity, secure in the knowledge that they were above scrutiny and prosecution and even if they were sent to jail, could live a 5 star luxury lifestyle while there, with home cooked meals, internet access, personal butlers and afternoon tea with the wardens. In the harsh light of intense media scrutiny, all that has changed. Things have got so bad that there\u2019s anecdotal evidence that industrialists are refusing to give bribes to politicians on the grounds that the politicians are not acting despite being bribed!!! \nThis is not the fear of an innocent person being unfairly accused, but of a guilty person being afraid being exposed. Accusing a politician of corruption in India is akin to handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500*. \nNow this may sound like a very positive change, and in fact, in the long run, it probably is. However, in the short run, it has had a chilling effect on all aspects of government action \u2013 no action is being taken on new projects, projects that have been approved are not being funded and even works in progress (like road construction) have halted as funds are not being disbursed. \nI have often made the argument that India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. However, India has a high need for government action in the arena of infrastructure, supply chains etc. and there\u2019s evidence that bottlenecks in the economy are creating a serious impediment to fast growth without inflationary pressure. In fact the Reserve Bank is so worried that it raised rates 50bps today and in effect told the government to get off its butt and deal with the bottlenecks -\n \u201cIt is important to recognize that in the absence of appropriate actions for addressing supply bottlenecks, especially in food and infrastructure, questions about the ability of the economy to sustain the current growth rate without significant inflationary pressures come to the fore. The economy's ability to grow rapidly for any length of time without provoking inflation is dependent on implementing policies, with corresponding resource allocations, which will allow the supply of various products and services to keep pace with demand.\u201d\n* Reference from the movie Apocalypse Now", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

{"prompt": "Write an analytical piece about why we got russia wrong", "answer": "Why we got Russia wrong\n\nIn 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF).\n\nI have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, \u201cThe four most dangerous words in the English language are \u2013 This Time it\u2019s Different\u201d. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that\u2019s why we got it wrong.\n\nWe manage EMF with a focus on the top down \u2013 our view is (and has been for the entire 28 years period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60-70% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors.\n\nWe do this in a primarily quantitative fashion \u2013 using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions \u2013 value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance.\n\nThis strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies.\n\nWith that as background, let\u2019s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis.\n\nRussia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum [BINU FIX THIS].\nGiven the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation.\n\nSo then the question became \u2013 in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether?\n\nAlas, we did not.\nWhat was our thinking behind this?\n\nWe believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all out assault on the entire country, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes.", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

{"prompt": "Discuss why we got russia wrong with data-driven insights", "answer": "But even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about-face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well.\n\nThe issues in our minds are \u2013 what could/should have we done differently?\n\nFirst of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex-ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Lets assume that I\u2019m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be to protect against black swan events, ie how much tail risk insurance should you buy?\n\nThe answer I come to is the same I did prior to this \u2013 very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions.\n\nThe next question is did we right size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide \u2013 our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not lead to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8-9%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin\u2019s eyes\u2026\nChina / Taiwan bekons\u2026", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

They\u2019re both equipment suppliers to a new technology that\u2019s going to change the world. And right now, like in 1998, everybody with half a brain can see that these new technologies are going to be huge. But, unfortunately, there are very few ways to play that glorious future that\u2019s in the near future.  We all know the story of Levi Strauss & Co. during the California Gold Rush \u2013 the equipment suppliers that made money in that bubble.  And so we see Cisco and Nvidia today in a similar vein.   But once the technology starts to be used to actually change the world, other companies are major bene\ufb01ciaries (like Amazon, Google etc.) and the equipment suppliers are correctly seen as commodity producers with low margins as competition seeps in.  And so it is today. Here\u2019s a chart of Cisco vs Nvidia starting 18 months before the top of the tech bubble on a similar time and return scale.\n\nAre we now at the top for Nvidia? That\u2019s unknowable.  As my colleague Jeremey Grantham likes to say, trying to \ufb01gure out the top of a bubble is like charting the path of a feather in a hurricane.

And so it was with Cisco\u2026   If you bought it at the top - almost 25 years later, you\u2019re still losing money.  \n  So will Nvidia follow suit? Inevitably.  What I predict is that sometime in the next 12 moths, we will see the peak. And you\u2019re a fool if you think you can time that event exactly.  My advice is to sell 1/12th of your Nvidia holding now and another 1/12th every month for the next 12 months irrespective of what the stock does. That way, if I\u2019m right that the top will be in the next 12 months, you will have got out near the top.

He is extremely plugged in \nwith the \ufb01 nancial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards.   He told a very convincing story about \nhow things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would bene \ufb01 t.   However, at \nthe end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions. \n In my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and \ufb01 nancial leaders \nabout what is likely to happen in India over the next few years.   None of their thoughts depended on government action.   If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today.\n That, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs.  India.   China succeeds if the government gets it right; India \nsucceeds if the government gets out of the way.   Both could happen.   Or neither.   In both cases, long-term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital.   So, what drives return on capital?\n One of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by \nEdward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me:  building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer.   Thus, building multiple high-speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure \ufb01 nancial terms.   If it were, the U.S.  would surely have built plenty of high-speed rail lines by now.  \n After all, the ability of the U.S.  consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer.   The fact that no high-speed rail lines exist in the U.S.  tells you something about the potential return on capital on high-speed rail in expansive continental geographies.\n In short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital.Now, let\u2019s look at India through this lens.   In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) \neverything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc.   Thus, people have dif \ufb01 cult lives, \nbut it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years).\n The one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones.   And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government \nactually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song).

{"prompt": "Discuss ad ruminationsonchina&india 1-11 with data-driven insights", "answer": "All rights reserved.none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world.   In \nfact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow pro \ufb01 ts by investing in telecoms outside of India. \n This is what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high pro \ufb01 ts because producers bene \ufb01 ted \nfrom shortages.\n Another interesting consequence of bad policy-making (India consistently runs high budget de \ufb01 cits) is the high cost \nof capital.   This forces producers to invest only in high-return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and bene\ufb01 ts investors by delivering high return on investment.\n Now this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India bene \ufb01 ts from bad \npolicy in the long run?   And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones?   Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high?   Brazil is another high-cost-of-capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth.\n I believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to \ngrow.   We already see in \ufb02 ation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, \nrising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure.   High in \ufb02 ation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets \nusually demand a discount from high-in \ufb02 ation countries.   Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead \nto permanent positive payoffs. \n Nevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom-\nup capitalism.   Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state-directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual pro \ufb01 t-\nmaximizers. \n In the \ufb01 nal analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors \nbased on their ability to produce and sustain high pro \ufb01 tability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very \nlittle to do with making money as investors. \n In short, don\u2019t focus on growth.

The reaso n we \nwanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in \nbetween that would be a closer proxy for how we man age money. \nFigure 2 shows our results using exactly the same m ethodology but with a time period limited to 1993-\n2013. \nFigure 2\n\nThe good news is that despite the shorter time peri od, the results look very much the same and so we \nare confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes. \nFigure 3 shows the same study, but now using square  root mcap to define the quintiles and mcap \nweighting within each quintile.  \nFigure 3 \n 0510 15 20 25 30 \nCountry size Prior year's \nreturn Dividend yield Currency Past GDP \ngrowth Future GDP \ngrowth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 \nEqual Weight \n0510 15 20 \nCountry size Prior year's \nreturn Dividend yield Currency Past GDP \ngrowth Future GDP \ngrowth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 \nMcap Weight Again the results don\u2019t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 \nand Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts ).   \nSince we think of value is being something differen t from Div Yield, we re-ran the equal weighted \nanalysis replacing Div Yield with Earnings Yield (u sing PE sliced 12). Figure 4 shows the results \u2013 cl early \nearnings yield works even better than Div Yield (an d the quintile run is monotonic), which should not \nsurprise anyone. \nFigure 4\n\nDisentangling the effects: \nLooking at these results, we wondered whether the c urrency and past GDP growth variables were just \nsimply a proxy for value \u2013 after all if a country h ad stumbled from a growth or currency point of view , \nthey were likely to be cheap. \nIn order to disentangle these effects we ran multip le regressions on these variables. \nWe ran a pooled regression using each of these indi vidually as the independent variable along with \nvalue and the forward 12 month return as the depend ent variable to see if the effect of this variable \nwould diminish or disappear when paired with value.\n\nTable 1 shows the T-stats for each variable in thes e regressions.

One \ncaveat: We do not think of this model as being some thing that should outperform independently, but \nshould be an enhancement to value. Figure 5 shows how our overall macro model would ha ve done from 1999-2013 (our model data only \ngoes back to 1999), and how each subcomponent would  have worked. Keep in mind that the leading \nindicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 1 2 month forward returns.\n\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 6 shows the same mcap weighted \nFigure 6 \n 0246810 12 14 16 18 20 \nLeading \nIndicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall M acro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 \nEqual Weight \n0246810 12 14 16 18 \nLeading \nIndicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall M acro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 \nMcap Weight Overall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand-alone basis, but the acid test for us is \nwhether this model truly enhances value. \nWe ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two togeth er. \nSince we have a limited dataset (only going back to  1999) but we have monthly scores for value and \nmacro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping d ata, which show some truly frightening T-stats. In \norder to deal with the overlapping data we used New ey-West T-stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the \nserial correlation. \nTable 2 shows the regression for Earnings Yield by itself, which shows that for one extra unit of earn ings \nyield; historically you got an extra 3.75% return. \nTable 2 \n  Earnings Yield  Adjusted R -Squared  \nBeta  3.75 7.0% \nT-Stat  12.01\n\nTable 3 shows the same for Macro, with an additiona l unit exposure to this factor (its a normalized \nvariable for one unit is one sigma) adding 10.47% r eturn.

However, the fallen currency effect and the \nfuture GDP effects remain strong even after adjusti ng for value. \nWe found that using sliced PE performed better than  Div yield. \nFinally we looked at how our new Macro model would have done using this framework and concluded \nthat it worked on a standalone basis, but more impo rtantly did indeed represent an enhancement to our \nvalue models for picking countries.\n\nEvelyn Huang \nArjun Divecha\n\nINTERNAL ONLY: Not for external distribution", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon.   During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well.   Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets. \n In the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow \nstrategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class.   With an investable market cap of $4 trillion and daily trading volume of around $40 billion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n While there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big cap vs.  small cap, value vs.  growth \u2013 we \nbelieve a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve.   Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure. \n In recent years, there has been much talk about the coupling/decoupling of emerging markets vis-\u00e0-vis the developed \nworld.   We \ufb01 nd this either/or characterization misses the mark when, in fact, the reality is far more complicated.  \n Perhaps a better way to think about growth in emerging markets is to characterize it as having two components: correlated growth , which is driven by links with the developed world, and uncorrelated growth , which depends more \non the internal dynamics and demographics of the emerging markets themselves. \n From this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth , while domestic \ndemand mostly represents uncorrelated growth .   Obviously, in a globalized world, there is a large overlap between \nthese two, with both positive and negative feedback loops.   However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven lean years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n The Case for Domestic Demand\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily \nto the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up.   Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years.   Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors.   In addition, because they compete globally, margins are likely to be squeezed by having to go toe-to-toe with well-capitalized global competitors.  2 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun \u2013 August 2011Global commodity producers may continue to do well (as they have over the previous decade) if commodity prices \nstay high or rise even further.   For most institutional investors, it makes sense to have an overall commodity strategy with commodity producers from emerging markets in the mix.   However, we do not believe that they represent an emerging \u201cpure play\u201d as they are driven by global rather than purely emerging market forces.\n The main case for the domestic demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the con \ufb02 uence of \ntwo forces:  economics and demographics.\n", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

{"prompt": "Discuss em - emerging consumers just want to have fun 8-11 with data-driven insights", "answer": "The Economic Case\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d \nwhere increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply.   As poor countries begin to get richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them.   For example, we have seen savings rates in emerging markets rise from 13% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35% today (see Exhibit 1).\n Exhibit 1\nSavings Rates Have Risen with Income in Emerging Markets\nHowever, once per capita GDP levels reach the range of $3,000 to $10,000, consumption rises and savings rates \ninevitably drop.   We believe that this occurs for two reasons.   First, at these levels of national wealth, societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets.   Second, individuals have newfound discretionary income, which they increasingly spend on consumer goods.   Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d of $3,000 to $10,000 per capita GDP and then drop.   Exhibit 2 shows this pattern in a number of developed markets as they became richer.

This was not the case 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago.   Thus, if economic growth remains strong in emerging markets, one can reasonably expect to see large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n Exhibit 3\n50% of Emerging Countries Are Now in the Sweet Spot of Shifting from Savings to Consumption\nWhile a number of sell-side analysts suggest that this story is already well-known and priced into markets, we beg to \ndiffer.   We believe when incomes reach this sweet spot, the elasticity of demand becomes highly non-linear, where small increases in per capita income lead to large increases in consumption.\n A simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales.   In the year 2000, Chinese crossed $1,000 per capita GDP.  In that \nyear, auto sales \ufb01 rst exceeded 1 million vehicles.   Ten years later, Chinese GDP more than quadrupled, to $4,400 per \ncapita.   What happened to auto sales?   Did they go from 1 million to 4 million? \n No.   They went from 1 million to 17 million!No analyst that we know of predicted anything close to these numbers.   It\u2019s very dif \ufb01 cult to forecast this kind of \ngrowth, so high growth forecasts tend to be 20% to 30% at each point in time, followed by upward revisions on a regular basis.\n As a result of these factors, we are reasonably con \ufb01 dent that per capita consumption in emerging market countries \nwill rise substantially in the next few years and that much of this consumption growth is not anticipated by markets.\n The Demographic Shift\nWhat makes an already good story potentially explosive is the fact that demographics are not static and indicate that \nthe number of people in their prime working (and consuming) years will also rise dramatically in the next few years (both in absolute terms and relative to the developed markets).\n Exhibit 4 shows the dependency ratio, which is de \ufb01 ned as the ratio of non-working-age to working-age people in both \nthe emerging and developed markets.

{"prompt": "Provide a thoughtful analysis of em - emerging consumers just want to have fun 8-11", "answer": "As the downward sloping line shows, demographics in emerging markets have improved dramatically over the last few years (with the dependency ratio falling) and they will remain in this sweet spot for the next few decades.

The overall global effect will be to shift consumption (as a result of increasing income) from the developed world to the emerging world.\n Economic Changes + Demographic Shift = Huge Increase in Consumer Base\nWith these global shifts in economics and demographics upon us, the focus of economic activity is likely to shift \ntoward domestic demand providers within emerging markets.   Exhibit 5 shows the number of people that one might term \u201cmiddle class\u201d (de \ufb01 ned as having an income greater than $6,000) that will be added to the emerging markets \nover the next \ufb01 ve years (assuming the continuation of current growth rates).   This number is far greater than the \ncurrent population of the United States.\n We are very con \ufb01 dent that, absent some global catastrophe, domestic demand in emerging market countries will be \nrobust over the next few years, irrespective of what may or may not happen in the developed world.\n So, what could derail this story?   The most likely candidate is oil rising to $200/barrel and staying there for an \nextended period.   In general, very high commodity prices would have a major impact on consumption in emerging markets, and would shift potential return from domestic demand companies to commodity producers.\n *  Percent of non-working to working people.\n Source:  United Nations6 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun \u2013 August 2011Exhibit 5\nIf Current Trends Persist, the Emerging Middle Class Will Increase by around 500 Million People \nin the Next 5 Years\nHow Does One Take Advantage of This?\n Recently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients if this anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies \nis best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets.   In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n At this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within \nemerging markets.   Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand. \n For example, if we screen the MS World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50% of their sales from \nemerging markets, we \ufb01 nd 183 companies that match.   These 183 companies have a total market value of $574 billion \nand make up only 2.1% of the market value of the MSCI World Index.

These advantages come from numerous sources, including high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well-established local brands, government policies that tend to favor locals, and the fact that local competitors are likely to have high pro \ufb01 tability \nand substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share. \n A good example is the Russian retail sector.   For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to be able to acquire \nland, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia, it would be extremely expensive.   In addition, they would have great dif \ufb01 culty competing against a well-established player such as Magnit, which runs 4,000 plus stores across \nall Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20% (both of which allow it to make life very dif \ufb01 cult for new \nentrants).   We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build out its own chain of stores in Russia.   In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where they paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer.   Thus, one of the fringe bene \ufb01 ts of investing in dominant local players \nis the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n This is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets.   In cases where \nmultinationals have a long-standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful.   For example, Unilever has had local operations in countries like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high pro \ufb01 tability in each market.   In some \ncases, it makes more sense to buy the locally-listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade-off between \u201cpure-play\u201d and valuation.   For example, Domino\u2019s Pizza has a market cap of $1.6 billion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3 billion, despite contributing less than 10% of the sales and 18% of the pro \ufb01 ts of the overall company.\n If our thesis of home \ufb01 eld advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed \nmultinationals in recent times.   Indeed, that has been the case over the past 5 years.   Exhibit 7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks.\n One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive from a \nvaluation point of view relative to developed multinationals.   Exhibit 8 shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals.   The reason domestic emerging companies outperformed was because their earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.Name Country Market Value ($M) % Sales to EM\nQUALCOMM Inc.

What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are pro \ufb01 ts that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders.   At this \npoint in time, we \ufb01 nd that the best (but not all) opportunities are local.\n Not All Domestic Opportunities Are Attractive\nAttractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are \npresent, some sectors are far more attractive than others.   At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). \n Similarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive.  Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents \nhigh pro \ufb01 tability.   Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure \nof the industry does not allow for high pro \ufb01 tability.   While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15 million net new \nsubscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so pro \ufb01 tability is low and likely to remain so \nuntil there is a fair amount of consolidation.   Thus, high growth in this sector is unlikely to translate into high returns for shareholders.\n On the other hand, the \ufb01 nancial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly \noligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well-established, highly pro \ufb01 table banks.   Only 2% of Indians have \ncredit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years.   Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should bene \ufb01 t from this growth without having to lower their margins.\n The key is to look for fast-growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows \nfor players to have high pro \ufb01 tability.   Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will \nallow them to command high pro \ufb01 tability in the face of non-linear demand increases are most attractive.

In my opinion, Mr.  Putin is trying to create a model of the\nmodern authoritarian state where private corporationsand government owned/controlled entities both servesome greater \u201cnational good\u201d in addition to attempting toenrich their shareholders. \n The Yukos case serves as a multi-pronged attempt in\nattaining this goal.

And, if the sordid history ofYukos is any guide, Mr.  Putin is not a leader lightlyscorned.

{"prompt": "Provide a thoughtful analysis of emthoughts where's my alpha 5-04", "answer": "GMO\u2019s experience suggests that markets systematically  underprice quality.  In the U.S. and developed \nmarkets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. \nSimilarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks us ually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More \nexcitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, st able, low-debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no \npremium) as the rest of the market today. \n Over the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had \nbeen planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality-Adjusted-Value\u201d \nmodel later this year.

One ramification is that the \namount of quality we own in the portf olio is related to how attractive qua lity stocks are on a valuation basis. \nThus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on \nwhat one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will al so have the effect of increasing the average size of \ncompany we own; given that small caps are no longer attrac tive, we are very comfortable with this change. In \ngeneral we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality -Adjusted-Value\u201d model, a nd we will be writing more \nabout it in the next Emerging Thoughts .\n\nFinally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is \nvalue and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of mome ntum is not affected by the positioning of value \n(that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other).   Overall, the changes we are making will make us less vul nerable to a downturn in value investing at both the \ncountry level and the stock level, but we ca nnot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier.\n\nWhat Should You Do About This? \nSo, when you hear from us that our ability to add valu e is diminished, what\u2019s the appropriate response?\n\nWhen we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. \nOne option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities ar e one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based \non our asset allocation group\u2019s 7-year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all \nof our asset allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to take money away from us  and give it to another em erging manager. However, \nas far as we can tell, this contraction of value h as not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, \nmoving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nThose of you who have been with us for a while have  enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to \ndeliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar year end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy \noutperformed its benchmark, the S& P/IFC Investable Composite Index\n1, by 13.1% after outperforming by \n4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in  2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in \nthe next couple of years, at least you were able to  reap the benefits of that compression along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have \nentered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be an y easy answers.

As one would expect, this group usuall y trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 \nshows, they have not become more attr active as value has become less attractive. \n Another group of stocks we follow quite closely is high  quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be \nthe most attractively priced opportunity in the market today.

In the U.S. and developed \nmarkets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. \nSimilarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks us ually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More \nexcitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, st able, low-debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no \npremium) as the rest of the market today. \n Over the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had \nbeen planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality-Adjusted-Value\u201d \nmodel later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our \nstock selection process to this new model in May 2004.

One ramification is that the \namount of quality we own in the portf olio is related to how attractive qua lity stocks are on a valuation basis. \nThus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on \nwhat one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will al so have the effect of increasing the average size of \ncompany we own; given that small caps are no longer attrac tive, we are very comfortable with this change. In \ngeneral we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality -Adjusted-Value\u201d model, a nd we will be writing more \nabout it in the next Emerging Thoughts .\n\nFinally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is \nvalue and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of mome ntum is not affected by the positioning of value \n(that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other).   Overall, the changes we are making will make us less vul nerable to a downturn in value investing at both the \ncountry level and the stock level, but we ca nnot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier.\n\nWhat Should You Do About This? \nSo, when you hear from us that our ability to add valu e is diminished, what\u2019s the appropriate response?\n\nWhen we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. \nOne option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities ar e one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based \non our asset allocation group\u2019s 7-year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all \nof our asset allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to take money away from us  and give it to another em erging manager. However, \nas far as we can tell, this contraction of value h as not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, \nmoving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nThose of you who have been with us for a while have  enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to \ndeliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar year end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy \noutperformed its benchmark, the S& P/IFC Investable Composite Index\n1, by 13.1% after outperforming by \n4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in  2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in \nthe next couple of years, at least you were able to  reap the benefits of that compression along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have \nentered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be an y easy answers.  We will continue to do the best job \nwe can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth,  tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a \ndifficult ride.\n\n1 The S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index is an independentl y maintained and published em erging market stock index. \nNotes: \nArjun Divecha is a portfolio manager, ba sed in Berkeley, California, for GMO. \nPerformance indicated herein repr esents supplemental AIMR perfor mance.

Thus, contrary to popular belief, \nmodest investment in the emerging markets leads to \nlower, rather than higher, portfolio risk for the glob- \nal investor (see also Brown [1991]).  Over the past \nfive years, a global investor who put 20% in an \nemerging markets index fund would have reduced \noverall annual portfolio risk from 18.3% to 17.5% \nwhile increasing annual return from 12.6% to 14.7%. \n One unexpected result of our research is that \nstock returns in the emerging markets tend to be \nmore homogeneous than in developed markets, \nimplying that a strong market force dominates \nindustry and stock-specific influences.

They fall into three regions: \nAsia, Latin America, and Europe/Middle East/Africa. \n Singapore and Hong Kong fall into most definitions of \ndeveloped markets, but are included here because they \nare closely related to the other Asian markets.  Colom- \nbia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, and Zimbabwe are not \nof great institutional interest at present, although Pak- \nistan has recently opened up its economy and financial \nmarkets to foreign investors and may well be next on \nthe list of emerging markets to attract institutional \ninterest.  Finally, Japanese over-the-counter (OTC) \nstocks are included in the list because they tend to \nbehave (and are perceived) differently from listed \nJapanese st:ocks. \n RETWIS AND RISKS OF \nEMERGING MARKETS \nThe casual reader of the financial press knows \nthere have been stories of incredible returns (high and \nlow) in the emerging markets.

What \nmakes this even more interesting is that the Taiwanese \nmarket is only the fourth or fifth most risky emerging \nmarket!

Clearly, these \n42 EMERGINZ MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 markets are extremely risky when compared with \ndeveloped markets.  Apart from the obvious risks \n(political instability, insider trading, etc.), there are a \nnumber of possible reasons why these markets are \nextremely volatile. \n First, they tend to be fairly concentrated; that \nis, the larger stocks have a high proportion of the over- \nall market capitalization.  As a result, there are fewer \nopportunities for diversification, and returns to these \nlarge stocks dominate the overall market return.  Sec- \nond, unlike the developed markets, which tend to have \nforces that affect diverse sectors of the economy differ- \nently, the emerging markets tend to have a strong mar- \nket-related force that affects all stocks within a market. \n This tends to accentuate volatility. \n There are some apparent anomalies in these \nresults.  Palustan, Jordan, Colombia, Nigeria, and Zim- \nbabwe appear to have had relatively low risk over the \nlast five years.  We believe that these low figures reflect \nthe lack of liquidity in these markets, so observed \nvolatilities (and correlations with other markets) must \nbe viewed with caution.  When we look at the \nturnover ratio (value tradedlmarket capitalization) for \neach market, we find that these five markets rank in \nthe bottom six (shown in Exhibit 1).  The real volatility \nis likely to be much higher, if and when these markets \nbecome more liquid. \n When we look at the emerging markets as a \ngroup (the BARRA Emerging World Universe of \nabout 4,000 stocks), we find that it has much lower \nvolatility than most of the individual markets.  This is \nbecause of low correlations between these markets. \n The diversification that these low correlations offer the \nglobal investor is one of the biggest benefits of invest- \ning in the emerging markets.  The volatility (over the \npast five years) of the BARRA Emerging World Uni- \nverse was about 28.0%, as compared to about 18.8% \nfor the S&P 500 or 22.8% for the Morgan Stanley \nEurope, Australia, and the Far East (EAFE) index. \n A MODEL TO UNDERSTAND \nRISK AND RETURN \nTo analyze risk and return in these markets, we \ndeveloped a multi-factor model similar to one previous- \nly constructed for the developed markets (see Grinold, \nRudd, and Stefek [1989]).  At the core of the model is a \nhierarchical decomposition of portfolio return into vari- \nous components.  This is dustrated in Ehbit 2.  EXHIBIT 2 \nEMERGING MARKETS MODEL \nWe focus on excess return, return beyond the \nrisk-free rate.  This return is initially broken down into \ncurrency return and excess return earned in local mar- \nkets.  Local excess return is decomposed further into \ncountry factor return, industry return, and return \naccruing to salient attributes of the companies in the \nportfolio, e.g.  the price/earnings ratio.  These latter \nsources of return are called risk indexes. \n The return to a global portfolio depends on the \nnumeraire or home country of the investor.

{"prompt": "Provide a thoughtful analysis of emerging markets - a quantitative perspective", "answer": "More pre- \ncisely, the excess return to an investment abroad is the \nproduct of the return of the investment in its local \nmarket, 1 + r1, and the exchange return 1 + r,.  With a \nlittle manipulation, this can be expressed as the sum of \nthree components: \nExcess Numeraire Return = \n(r, + rfl - rd - (ri - rfl) + r, x q, or, (1) \nCurrency Return - Local Excess Return + \nCross-Product \nwhere rf is the risk-free rate of return in the country of \nthe investor, and rfl is the risk-free rate in the market \nwhere the investment is being made.  The first term in \nEquation (1) is the currency return, reflecting both the \nexchange return and the differential in interest rates \nbetween countries.  The second term is the local excess \nreturn of the investment in its own market. \n The final term, r, x r1 (also known as the cross- \nproduct) poses a problem for development of a linear \nmodel.  For most countries, this cross-product term is \nFALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 43 typically small and can be disregarded for the purposes \nof forecasting risk.  For example, ignoring the cross- \nproduct reduces the annual risk of the Korean market \nby 51 basis points (from 29.62% to 29.11%), and of the \nTaiwanese market by 103 basis points.  In such cases, \none can sa.fely ignore the cross-product because it is \nsmall relative to overall market risk. \n This is not true for Argentina or Brazil, where \nthere are huge swings in exchange rates.  Over the past \nfive years, ignoring the cross-product would have \nchanged the annual risk of the Argentinean market by \n17% and the Brazilian market by 4%. \n To circumvent this difficulty, we do not try to \ndecompose the Brazilian and Argentinean asset returns \ninto local and currency components but rather model \nthese assets from the U.S.  perspective.  In other words, \nwe trans1at:e the prices of Brazilian and Argentinean \nassets into U.S.  dollars and model the U.S.  dollar- \ndenomina,ted returns of these assets.  Happily, this \napproach :is consistent with investors\u2019 tendency to \nthink of these assets in U.S.  dollars. \n Next, local excess return is broken down into \nthree components: country factor return, industry \nreturn, and risk index return.  The amount of an asset\u2019s \nriturn arising from each component depends on its \nexposure to that source.  The exposure of an asset to \nthe country factor is its beta with respect to that mar- \nket.  Moreover, assets are exposed only to their own \nlocal markets.  In contrast, industry and risk indexes are \nglobal factors in the model, i.e., it is assumed that these \nfactors apply equally across countries. \n Industry exposure is defined using the Financial \nTimes Wcdd industry classification.  Each asset is \nassigned to exactly one of the thirty-six industry cate- \ngories. \n The risk indexes include size, success, yield, \nvariability in markets, earnings-to-price ratio, book- \nto-price ra.tio, and liquidity.  Exposures to these risk \nindexes are normalized within each country.  Thus, \nthese exposures measure how an asset compAres to the \nrest of its local market. \n A formal statement of our model for monthly \nlocal excess return is for asset n: \nLocal Excess = Country Factor + Industry Factor + \nRisk Index Factor + Specific Return \n44 EMERGING MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE where \nasset n \nthe ith \nf(i) are k = 1, number of countries \nj = 1, number of industries \ni = 1, number of risk indexes \nP(n,k), y(n,j), and x(n,i) are the exposures of \nto the kth country factor, the jth industry, and \nrisk index, respectively.  Variables h(k), g(j), and \nreturns to these factors.  In estimating the factor \nreturns, the exposures are determined from the begin- \nning of month data.  The part of the return that is not \nexplained by these factors is called the specific return, \nu(n); it is unique to the company. \n The model was estimated for assets fbrn the twen- \nty-three markets listed in Exhibit 1 over the period Febru- \nary 1986 to July 1991.  Data are drawn from numerous \nsources includmg the International Finance Corporation \nand proprietary sources in thirteen countries. \n The results of the modeling process reveal some \ninteresting differences between emerging and devel- \noped markets.

{"prompt": "Explain emerging markets - a quantitative perspective with nuanced observations", "answer": "The overall proportion of variance \nexplained by the emerging markets model (adjusted \nR2 ) is 50%, as compared with 38% for a :similar model \nthat covers the developed markets (countries covered \nby the Financial Times Indices).  At first glance it may \nseem surprising that a quantitative model would \nexplain a greater proportion of return in the emerging \nmarkets than the developed markets.  In order to \nunderstand this further, we looked at two submodels. \n The first submodel was built using only indus- \ntry factors; i.e., we looked at what proportion of \nreturn is explained by the industry that a company is \nin, ignoring the country factors and :risk indexes. \n Thus, a definition of this model is: \n(3) \nLocal Excess Return = Industry Fa.ctor + \nSpecific Return \nWe find the adjusted R2 for this rnodel for the \nemerging markets to be 16%, compared with 22% for \nthe developed markets.  This is a measure of how \n\u201cglobal\u201d or integrated industries are across countries.  It \nstands to reason that the developed rnarkets have \nindustries that are better integrated than the emerging \nones, but the fact that the difference is small implies \nthat there are cross-country industry commonalities in \nthe emerging markets as well. \n The second submodel was built using only \nFALL 1992 country factors.  Thus, we looked at what proportion \nof return is explained by country factors alone, ignor- \ning the industry factor and risk indexes.  The definition \nof this model is: \nLocal Excess Return = Country Factor + \nSpecific Return \nThe adjusted R2 for this model for the emerg- \ning markets is 46% compared with 30% for the devel- \noped markets.  Clearly, this country factor is the major \nforce driving emerging markets.  As one would expect, \nindustries play a larger part in explaining return in the \ndeveloped markets, while country differences play a \nlarger role in the emerging markets. \n HOMOGENEITY WITHIN MARKETS \nThe fact that country factors explain such a large \nproportion of variance (in absolute terms and when \ncompared with the developed markets) in the emerging \nmarkets bears a closer look.  That is, stock returns tend \nto be more homogeneous (within a market) in the \nemerging markets than in developed markets.  In other \nwords, when the market moves, there is a strong ten- \ndency for all stocks in the market to move with it. \n This difference in the proportion of return \nexplained by the market factor (46% in emerging mar- \nkets versus 30% in developed countries) is not a func- \ntion of capitalization weighting (which leads to larger \ncompanies dominating the regression).  Even when we \nequally weight each stock in the regression we find the \nsame effect persists.  The comparable R2 when equally \nweighting all stocks in the emerging markets is 42% \n(compared with 29% in the developed markets). \n At first appearance, it may seem odd that the \nproportion of variance explained by the market factor \nis so large in these markets.  In order to understand \nthis, we look at various effects that may cause this to \nhappen. \n First, it may result from a concentration effect, a \nfew large companies so dominating the market that \nthey are, in effect, the market.  Second, it may well be \nthat these markets are actually more homogeneous \n(i.e., all the stocks tend to move together).  Finally, \nthere tends to be a positive correlation between the \nmagnitude of returns within a market and the R2, i.e., to some extent, the high R2 is a natural by-product of \nhigh volatility. \n We first look at the concentration effect; that is, \nwhether these markets tend to be dominated by a few \nlarge stocks.  Exhibit 3 shows the proportion of market \ncapitalization that the top ten stocks represent in each \nmarket. \n Most emerging markets are more concentrated \nthan the developed markets.  Hong Kong and Singa- \npore, perhaps the two most developed of the emerging \nmarkets, are highly concentrated by this measure.  On \nthe other hand, Malaysia, Brazil, Inla, and Korea are \nnot signlficantly more concentrated than the U.K.  Of \ncourse, simply looking at the biggest ten stocks in a \nmarket is not a particularly insightful way to judge con- \ncentration because it ignores all the other companies. \n", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

{"prompt": "Analyze emerging markets - a quantitative perspective from an investment perspective", "answer": "Exhibit 3 shows two other more meaningful \nmeasures of concentration: asset concentration and \nsector concentration.  Concentration is defined as (sim- \nilar to Roll [1990]): \nConcentration = [(N/N - 1) x C(h, - l/N)2]0.5 (5) \nwhere: \nN = Total number ofstocks (or industries), and \nh, = Weight in asset (or industry) n. \n Asset concentration looks at how different a \nmarket is from being equally weighted.  If each stock in \nthe market had exactly the same market capitalization, \nthis measure would be zero.  If the entire market capi- \ntalization were concentrated in one company, the mea- \nsure would be one. \n In an extremely diversified market like the U.S., \nthe score is 0.08.  Looking at this measure for the \nemerging markets, we can clearly see that they are \nmore concentrated, but that the larger ones (Taiwan, \nKorea, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.) tend to have numbers \nthat are not much larger than the developed markets \nThe average for these four markets is 0.13.  Thus, \nwhile asset concentration plays an important role in \nunderstanding why these markets appear homoge- \nneous, there must be other factors at work as well. \n Another measure of concentration is sector \nconcentration.  If most of the stocks in a market are \nconcentrated in one industry, it would make sense that \nthey would tend to move together.

A score of zero implies \nthat companies are equally distributed across all indus- \ntries, while a score of one implies that all the compa- \nnies are in one industry. \n The indication is that the emerging markets are \nmore concentrated than the developed markets, but \nnot much more so (although there is a popular percep- \ntion that inany emerging market countries are highly \nconcentrated in certain sectors).  In fact we see that \nKorea, Ckile, and Malaysia have less sector concentra- \ntion than the U.S., U.K., and Japan.  The countries that \nare most highly concentrated in a few sectors are the \nsmaller ones like Jordan and Nigeria.  It seems clear from these results that the emerging markets are quite \ndiversified across industries; the perception that their \nreturns are driven by the fortunes of a single sector \n(like natural resources) is erroneous. \n What then explains the fact that stocks in these \nmarkets tend to move together?  We looked at the pos- \nsibility that these markets are indeed more homoge- \nneous, after adjusting for the concentration effect.  One \nway to do ths is to look at the average correlation of \ntotal monthly stock returns within a market, over a \nperiod of time.  Exhibit 3 shows the average (i.e., \nunweighted) correlation between all stocks within \neach market (over the past five years). \n 46 EMEILGINI; MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 This is clearly higher for most of the emerging \nmarkets than the developed markets.  With the excep- \ntion of the Japanese OTC market, all the other large \nemerging markets have high average correlations.  Tai- \nwan has an average correlation of 0.77, Turkey 0.81, \nand Brazil 0.70.  By comparison, the U.S.  has an aver- \nage correlation of 0.49 and Japan 0.46.

{"prompt": "Write an analytical piece about emerging markets - a quantitative perspective", "answer": "Because these \ncorrelations are unweighted, market capitalization does \nnot play a role in determining this number. \n This implies that a single market force tends to \nhave a large impact on the movement of stock prices \nin these markets.  Even though we saw that these mar- \nkets are fairly well-diversified across industries, these \nindustry differentials are overwhelmed by the domi- \nnant market force. \n Another reason for the high R2 numbers in the \nemerging markets is the fact that there is likely to be a \npositive relationship between R2 and market voladity. \n For example, if the market moves up 50% in a month, \nthe likelihood is that almost all stocks in that market \nwill also move up.  Thus, one would expect to see \nhigher R2 for the more volatile markets.  We find that \nthis is indeed true; if one excludes the most risky mar- \nkets (Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan), and the \nlow liquidity ones (Pakistan, Jordan, Colombia, Nige- ria, and Zimbabwe) the average R2 for the emerging \nmarkets is sidar to that for the developed markets. \n Overall, from a global investor\u2019s viewpoint, this \nhomogeneity phenomenon implies that being in the \nright market at the right time is more important than \nthe ability to pick good stocks within that market. \n Clearly, if you are going to be in Brazil in a month \nwhen the market moves up 50%, the high within-mar- \nket correlations (0.70 for Brazil) are likely to ensure \nthat any diversified portfolio will experience high pos- \nitive returns.  From a global investor\u2019s point of view, the \nimpact of this conclusion is accentuated by the low \nacross-market correlations. \n HETEROGENEITY ACROSS MARKETS \nThis phenomenon of homogeneity does not \napply across markets.  In fact, we see that the emerging \nmarkets are much less correlated with each other than \nare the developed markets.  Exhibit 4 shows the corre- \nlations of emerging markets with each other.  While \nwe see that some markets tend to move together \n(Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore), most markets \ntend to have very low correlations with each other.

{"prompt": "Discuss emerging markets - a quantitative perspective with data-driven insights", "answer": "First, many of \nthe emerging markets have (or had) few economic and \ntrade lir ks with each other.  Consequently, their \neconomies tend to be unrelated to each other. \n Second, many have (or had) severe restrictions \non outsiders participating in their markets.  Therefore, \nthey are somewhat insulated from worldwide (or \neven regional) patterns in stock market returns.  For \nexample, in October 1987, while the world's markets \nwere crashing, the Indian stock market was up mod- \nestly. \n Nlow the current trend is for most of the \nemerging economies to develop greater trade links \nwith the developed world and each other.  Most of the \ncountries that are closed to foreign participation in \ntheir stock markets are also in the process of liberaliz- \ning rules for foreigners to participate in their markets. \n With these increasing links between markets, we \nshould expect to see correlations between the emerg- \ning markets increase in the future. \n When we contrast these low correlations with \nthe correlations between developed markets (Exhibit 5), we see that they have much higher correlations \nwith each other.  A quick glance at Exhibits 4 and 5 \nconfirms that the developed markets are much more \ncorrelated with each other than the emerging markets \nare.  The average correlation between the developed \nmarkets was 0.49 (over the same five-year period). \n While all the correlations between the developed mar- \nkets were positive, 89 of the 276 correlations between \nthe emerging markets were negative (over this five- \nyear period). \n From a global investor's point of view, a more \ninteresting question is not so much how the emerg- \ning markets relate to each other, but how they relate \nto the developed markets, individually and as a \ngroup.

As these markets develop greater links \n(financial and trade) with the developed markets, they \nwill undoubtedly become more highly correlated. \n Thus, there is a \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d currently \navailable -- one should indulge while the opportunity \nexists.  One does not need to have high return forecasts \nfor these :markets to enjoy the fruits of diversification. \n The flip side of the low correlations across mar- \nkets and homogeneity within markets is that country \nselection becomes more important for the active man- \nager.  There is greater volatility and greater return asso- \nciated with country selection than in the developed \nmarkets.  Managers interested in entering the emerging \nmarkets arena should give great consideration to their \ncoun.try allocation process, perhaps more so than they \ndo in the developed markets.  This does not imply that \nstock selection by active managers is any less important \nor easier, simply that country selection has a bigger \nimpact ori overall portfolio returns. \n To the extent that one decides to focus on \ncoun.try selection rather than stock picking, the homo- \ngeneity within markets comes to one\u2019s aid.  A conse- \nquen.ce of the homogeneity within markets is that one \ncan construct baskets of stocks that will mimic the per- \nform.ance of the overall market index with relatively \nlow tracking error.  This is particularly important in the \nemerging markets, because the smaller stocks tend to \nbe extremely illiquid.  Thus, one can form baskets of \nrelatively liquid stocks that will track the overall index \nfairly well.. \n Exhibit 8 shows the number of stocks required \nto track the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX Index \nin Taiwan, and the S&P 500.  If one wants to construct \na basket (of stocks whose performance wdl track the \nrelevant :index to within 1% per year (with a two- \nthirds probability), one would need about 75 stocks in \nTaiwan, 90 in Thailand, and 135 in the U.S.2 When \none accounts for that fact that the Thai and Taiwanese EXHIBIT 8 \nCOMPARISON OF TRACKING ERROIR \nIN DIFFERENT MARKETS \nNumber of Stocks required to track tile Inde-K \n0 100 200 300 400 500 \nNumber of Stocks \n-X-Thailand -Taiwan --S&PS(Po 1 \nindexes have fewer stocks than the S&E\u2019 500, all three \nrequire about the same proportion of stocks to track \nthe index with similar tracking error. \n Finally, given that many of the emerging mar- \nkets are projected to have higher real economic growth \nthan the developed markets, one would expect that \nstock market return (over the medium to long term) \nwould reflect this.  Coupled with the diversification \nbenefit, one can make a strong case for global investors \nto add investments in the emerging m.arkets to their \nportfolios. \n ENDNOTES \n\u2018Sources: \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook 1991,\u201d pub- \n2According to BARRA\u2019s Emerging Markets Equity Model.  lished by the International Finance Corporation; BPARA. \n REFERENCES \nBrown, Rob.  \u201cksk and Return in the Emerging Markets.\u201d Investing, \nSpring 1991. \n Grinold, kchard, Andrew Rudd, and Dan Stefel;.  \u201cGlobal Factors: \nFact or Fiction?\u201dJournal of Portfolio Management, Fall 1989, pp.  79-88. \n Roll, Richard.  \u201cIndustrial Structure and the Comparative Behavior of \nInternational Stock Market Indices.\u201d Working paper, June 1990. \n", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style.

{"prompt": "Write an analytical piece about india badla revised", "answer": "Shooting the Messenger?\n\nOn July 2, the 100-year badla system will give away to a T+ 5 compulsory rolling settlement system. While this change is ostensibly geared to creating a more transparent system, the timing of the move reflects paranoia on the part of the authorities and will only exacerbate the bear market. The main casualty has been and will continue to be liquidity!\n\nA liquid stock market enables capital to get allocated quickly and efficiently, benefiting investors, companies and governments.  Today, investors pay significant premiums for liquidity in all equity markets. In an increasingly competitive world for investment dollars, one of the few advantages Indian markets had was liquidity and depth.  Unlike other emerging markets where only a handful of stocks are liquid, India boasted tens of stocks that traded over $100 million a day each; greatly increasing it\u2019s attractiveness to large investors.\n\nWhy does liquidity matter? There are several companies in emerging markets that are more profitable, but more undervalued on any metric when compared to Indian companies. Take an example of Thai Union Frozen - it\u2019s the equivalent of Infosys in the global shrimp business with revenues of $800 million (twice that of Infosys) and profits of $50 million. It has a return on equity of 20% and earnings growth of 15-20% annually. Yet it has a market value of less than $300 million as compared to $8 billion for Infosys. Why is so undervalued? The shrimp business is certainly less sexy than software, but at the end of the day they are both cyclical commodity businesses. The main reason for the difference in value is liquidity as it trades a measly $50,000 to $100,000 a day versus $200 -300 million for Infosys. While it is easy to dismiss Thailand today, lets not forget that in 1994 the market traded over $1 billion a day (when India traded $20-30 million a day).\n\nImplicit in today\u2019s Indian market multiples is a premium for liquidity. As liquidity reduces, it can easily set up a vicious circle leading to valuations for software leaders to drop to 10 to 15 times (or less) earnings. We have already seen this happen with the second and third tier software companies. This effectively increases the cost of capital impacting their global competitiveness. The dream that software exports will reach $80 billion by 2008 will remain just that.\n\nIt's easy to want to find scapegoats for a vicious bear market. Bursting the global tech bubble of 1998-2000 caused pain everywhere, not just in India. The high liquidity associated with this bubble may now appear speculative and harmful but lets not forget the benefits that India enjoyed from it. Liquidity enabled a lot of companies to raise cheap capital and improve balance sheets. Today, in the technology downturn this capital will help them survive. The boom in stock prices created unprecedented media publicity for the Indian software story. It resulted in India being on the investment horizon of a lot of institutions that earlier avoided it.\n\nTo Indian regulators, futures and options may seem to be the panacea to cure the evils of badla (of which there are undoubtedly many). However, they have not been successful in any emerging market we know of. The biggest investors in most emerging markets are foreign and domestic mutual funds - they are severely constrained in the use of such derivative instruments. In nascent capital markets, small domestic investors don\u2019t really understand the intricacies of such instruments and end up being losers. Who then will use these derivatives? Ketan Parikh?\n\nSEBI has recently released the list of companies which will have options traded.  Some companies that were trading more than $300 million a day have been excluded, presumably on the ground that they were speculative favourites. Lets not forget that speculation and investment are two sides of the same coin. It's impossible to have one without the other. It should not be the role of the market regulator to decide which stocks should have options (and therefore affect capital allocation) - let the market decide that. If there are then abuses of market manipulation, they should use the existing laws on the books to deal with them.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss successful homegrown systems and go in for fancy American toys. However, non-market solutions to a market-based problem are inevitably a recipe for disaster. Lets not shoot the messenger!", "system": "Write in a clear, analytical, and insightful investment commentary style. Use nuanced observations, data-driven insights, and thoughtful analysis.
