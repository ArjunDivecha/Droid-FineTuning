{"prompt": "Explain the concept of compound interest.", "answer": "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Unlike simple interest, which is calculated only on the principal amount, compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time. For example, if you invest $1000 at 5% compound interest annually, after the first year you'll have $1050, after the second year you'll earn interest on $1050 (not just the original $1000), resulting in $1102.50. This snowball effect is why compound interest is often called the 'eighth wonder of the world' and is crucial for long-term investing.", "system": "You are a financial educator explaining investment concepts clearly."}
