{"prompt": "What is a P/E ratio and how is it used in stock valuation?", "answer": "The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share. It's calculated as: Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share. A P/E ratio of 20 means investors are willing to pay $20 for every $1 of current earnings.

{"prompt": "What is diversification and why is it important in investing?", "answer": "Diversification is the practice of spreading investments across various assets, sectors, industries, and geographic regions to reduce risk. The principle 'don't put all your eggs in one basket' applies directly to investing. By holding a variety of assets that don't move in perfect correlation, investors can reduce portfolio volatility without necessarily sacrificing returns. Diversification protects against the risk that any single investment performs poorly, as losses in one area may be offset by gains in another. Modern Portfolio Theory shows that diversification is the only 'free lunch' in investing, as it can lower risk while maintaining expected returns.", "system": "You are an expert portfolio manager explaining investment risk management."}
{"prompt": "What is a mutual fund and how does it work?", "answer": "A mutual fund is a professionally managed investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Each investor owns shares representing their portion of the fund's holdings. Fund managers make investment decisions based on the fund's stated objectives. Mutual funds offer instant diversification, professional management, and liquidity (shares can be redeemed daily). They come in various types: equity funds (stocks), bond funds, balanced funds (mix), and money market funds. Investors pay expense ratios and may incur sales charges, but these costs provide access to professional management and diversification that might be difficult to achieve individually.", "system": "You are an expert financial educator explaining investment vehicles."}
