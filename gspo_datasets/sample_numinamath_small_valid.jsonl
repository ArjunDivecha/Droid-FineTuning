  "answer": "First, convert the numbers to base $10$ if necessary for clarity:\n- $5_8$ in base $10$ is $5$.\n- $13_8$ in base $10$ is $1 \\times 8 + 3 = 11$.\n\nNow, add these numbers in base $10$:\n\\[ 5 + 11 = 16 \\]\n\nNext, convert $16$ in base $10$ back to base $8$:\n- $16 \\div 8 = 2$ remainder $0$, so the last digit is $0$.\n- The quotient $2$ is less than $8$, so it becomes the next digit.\n\nThus, $16_{10} = 20_8$.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c}\n & & & 5_8 \\\\\n+ & & 1 & 3_8 \\\\\n\\hline\n & & 2 & 0_8 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the sum is $\\boxed{20_8}$.",
