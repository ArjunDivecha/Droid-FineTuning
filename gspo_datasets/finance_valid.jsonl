{"prompt": "Explain the concept of dollar-cost averaging.", "answer": "Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where an investor invests a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. For example, investing $500 monthly in a mutual fund. This approach reduces the impact of market volatility by purchasing more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. DCA eliminates the risk of making large investments at market peaks and removes emotional decision-making. While it may underperform lump-sum investing in consistently rising markets, it historically provides better risk-adjusted returns and helps investors avoid timing the market, which most professionals consider impossible to do consistently.", "system": "You are an expert financial advisor explaining investment strategies."}
