{"prompt": "Michelle needs a drying rack for each three pounds of pasta she makes, and it takes a certain number of cups of flour to make each pound of pasta dough. She owns three racks right now. Michelle will need 1 more drying rack if she makes pasta using three 8-cup bags of flour. How many cups of flour does it take to make each pound of pasta dough?", "answer": "Let's denote the number of cups of flour needed to make each pound of pasta dough as x cups/pound.\n\nMichelle currently has three drying racks, and each rack can handle three pounds of pasta. Therefore, with her current racks, she can dry 3 racks * 3 pounds/rack = 9 pounds of pasta.\n\nIf Michelle uses three 8-cup bags of flour, she has a total of 3 bags * 8 cups/bag = 24 cups of flour.\n\nSince Michelle will need 1 more drying rack when she uses all 24 cups of flour, it means she will be making more than 9 pounds of pasta (because she can already handle 9 pounds with her current racks).\n\nThe next multiple of three pounds (since each rack can handle three pounds) after 9 pounds is 12 pounds. This means that with 24 cups of flour, Michelle can make 12 pounds of pasta, which requires 4 drying racks (one more than she currently has).\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of cups of flour per pound of pasta dough:\n\n24 cups of flour / 12 pounds of pasta = 2 cups of flour per pound of pasta dough.\n\nTherefore, it takes $\\boxed{2}$  cups of flour to make each pound of pasta dough.", "system": "You are an expert mathematician.

{"prompt": "Two years ago, Ram put $1,000 into a savings account. At the end of the first year, his account had accrued some interest bringing his total balance to $1,100. The next year, his account balance increased by 20%. At the end of the two years, Ram's account balance increased by 32% from his initial deposit of $1,000. How much interest did his account accrue in the first year?", "answer": "At the end of the first year, Ram's account balance was $1,100. This means that his account accrued $100 in interest during the first year because $1,000 (initial deposit) + $100 (interest) = $1,100 (end of first year balance).\n\nTo confirm this, let's calculate the total interest accrued over the two years to see if it matches the 32% increase from the initial deposit.\n\nAt the end of the second year, Ram's account balance increased by 20%. To find out how much this is, we calculate 20% of the balance at the end of the first year:\n\n20% of $1,100 = 0.20 * $1,100 = $220\n\nSo, at the end of the second year, his account balance increased by $220 due to interest. Adding this to the balance at the end of the first year:\n\n$1,100 (end of first year balance) + $220 (second year interest) = $1,320 (end of second year balance)\n\nNow, let's check if this is a 32% increase from the initial deposit:\n\n32% of $1,000 = 0.32 * $1,000 = $320\n\nAdding this to the initial deposit:\n\n$1,000 (initial deposit) + $320 (32% increase) = $1,320\n\nSince the end of second year balance ($1,320) matches the initial deposit plus a 32% increase ($1,320), the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the interest accrued in the first year was $\\boxed{\\$100}$ .", "system": "You are an expert mathematician.

To find the monotonicity intervals, calculate the derivative:\n$$f'(x) = 2x - \\frac{2}{x^{2}} - \\frac{4}{x}.$$\nWithin the domain of definition $x > 0$, we analyze the sign of the derivative to determine the monotonicity. Setting $f'(x) > 0$ leads to $x > \\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$. Conversely, setting $f'(x) < 0$ gives $0 < x < \\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$. Therefore, the function is decreasing on $(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2})$ and increasing on $(\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}, +\\infty)$.\n\n(II)\nWith the derivative $f'(x) = 2x - \\frac{2}{x^{2}} + \\frac{a}{x}$ and the condition that $f(x)$ is increasing on $[1, +\\infty)$, we must have $f'(x) \\geqslant 0$ on $[1, +\\infty)$.

The maximal value of $h(x)$ is found at $x = 1$. Hence, $h_{\\text{max}} = h(1) = 0$, leading to $a \\geqslant 0$.\n\n(III)\nNow consider $g(x) = x^{2}f'(x) = 2x^{3} + ax - 2$. The derivative of $g(x)$ is $g'(x) = 6x^{2} + a$.\n\nFor $a \\geqslant 0$, $g'(x) = 6x^{2} + a > 0$, meaning $g(x)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, +\\infty)$ and thus has no minimum value.\nFor $a < 0$, we find the critical point of $g(x)$ by setting $g'(x) = 0$, which gives us $x = \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6}}$. The function $g(x)$ decreases on $(0, \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6}})$ and increases on $(\\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6}}, +\\infty)$. Therefore, $g(x)$ attains its minimum value at $x = \\sqrt{-\\frac{a}{6}}$.\n\nBy equating the minimum value of $g(x)$ to $-6$, we get:\n$$- \\frac{a}{3} \\sqrt{- \\frac{a}{6}} + a \\sqrt{- \\frac{a}{6}} - 2 = -6,$$\nwhich gives us $a = -6$.\n\nHence, the explicit expression of $f(x)$ is:\n$$\\boxed{f(x) = x^{2} + \\frac{2}{x} - 6 \\ln x}.$$", "system": "You are an expert mathematician.

For the sake of this problem, we'll assume a chi-square statistic and use commonly accepted critical values for a 95% confidence level.\n\nThe chi-square statistic's critical value for 95% confidence is typically around 3.841 (depending on degrees of freedom which is not mentioned in the problem), derived from chi-square distribution tables or computational tools. If our chi-square statistic **k** exceeds this value, we can be confident at the 95% level that there is an association between event A and B.\n\nOn the other hand, a lower value of the chi-square statistic represents weaker evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e., the hypothesis that there is no association between the events).

If point $Q$ is the midpoint of $MN$, find the equation of the locus of point $Q$.", "answer": "### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Part $(1)$ Finding the Equation of the Line $l$\n\n- **Case 1: Slope Does Not Exist**\n\nIf the slope of the tangent line does not exist, the only line through $P(2,1)$ vertical to the x-axis and tangent to the circle is $x=2$. This straight line does not slope and is tangent at the point where $x=2$ intersects the circle.\n\n- **Case 2: Slope Exists**\n\nAssume the slope of the tangent line exists. Then, let the equation of the tangent line be $y = k(x - 2) + 1$, where $k$ is the slope of the line.\n\nThe distance $d$ from the center of the circle $(0,0)$ to the tangent line is given by the formula $d = \\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$, where $ax + by + c = 0$ is the general form of the line equation and $(x_0, y_0)$ is a point through which the line passes. For our line, $a = k$, $b = -1$, and $c = 1 - 2k$, and $(x_0, y_0) = (0,0)$, the center of the circle.\n\nThus, the distance $d$ from the center of the circle to the tangent line can be calculated as $d = \\frac{|2k - 1|}{\\sqrt{1 + k^2}} = 2$ (since the radius of the circle is $2$). Solving this equation for $k$, we find $k = -\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent line, substituting $k = -\\frac{3}{4}$ into $y = k(x - 2) + 1$, simplifies to $3x + 4y - 10 = 0$.\n\n- **Conclusion for Part $(1)$**\n\nThe equation of the tangent line $l$ can either be $x=2$ or $3x + 4y - 10 = 0$.

To find the length of the nylon cord, we need to find the radius of the semicircle.\n\nThe circumference of a full circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius. Since the dog only runs a semicircle, the arc length is half the circumference of a full circle.\n\nSo, the arc length (L) of the semicircle is given by L = πr.\n\nWe know the arc length is approximately 30 feet, so we can set up the equation:\n\n30 = πr\n\nTo solve for r, we divide both sides by π:\n\nr = 30 / π\n\nUsing the approximation π ≈ 3.14159, we get:\n\nr ≈ 30 / 3.14159\nr ≈ 9.5493 feet\n\nTherefore, the approximate length of the nylon cord is about $\\boxed{9.55}$  feet.", "system": "You are an expert mathematician.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this function and determine the corresponding values of \\( x, y, z \\).\n\n2. In order to find the maximum value, we will first analyze the conditions under which each term in the function could be negative or positive.
