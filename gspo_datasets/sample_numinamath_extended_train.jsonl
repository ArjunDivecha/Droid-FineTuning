  "answer": "#### Part (a)\n1. Consider a tetrahedron \\( SABC \\) where the edges \\( SA, SB, \\) and \\( SC \\) are mutually perpendicular and their lengths are \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\) respectively.\n2. We choose a coordinate system with origin at \\( S \\), and \\( SA \\) along the \\( x \\)-axis, \\( SB \\) along the \\( y \\)-axis, and \\( SC \\) along the \\( z \\)-axis.\n3. The coordinates of points \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are \\( A(a, 0, 0), B(0, b, 0), \\) and \\( C(0, 0, c) \\).\n4. The equation of the plane passing through points \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} + \\frac{z}{c} = 1\n   \\]\n5. To find the side of the largest cube with vertex at \\( S \\), we consider the diagonal of the cube passing through \\( S \\) whose equation can be expressed as \\( x = y = z \\).\n6. Substituting \\( x = y = z \\) into the plane equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{x}{b} + \\frac{x}{c} = 1\n   \\]\n7. Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   x \\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right) = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{a b c}{a b + b c + a c}\n   \\]\n8. Therefore, the side length of the cube with the largest volume that lies entirely within the tetrahedron is:\n    \\[\n    a_0 = \\frac{a b c}{a b + b c + a c}\n    \\]\n\n   Conclusion.\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{a b c}{a b + b c + a c}}\n   \\]\n\n#### Part (b)\n\n1. To determine the dimensions of the largest rectangular parallelepiped with vertex at \\( S \\) that lies entirely within the tetrahedron, we set:\n   \\[\n   V = xyz\n   \\]\n2. Given the constraint:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} + \\frac{z}{c} = 1\n   \\]\n3. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers or the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means for three variables.\n\n4. The maximum volume \\( V \\) of the rectangular parallelepiped can be found as:\n   \\[\n   V = x y z = a b c \\left(\\frac{x}{a} \\cdot \\frac{y}{b} \\cdot \\frac{z}{c}\\right) \\leq a b c \\left(\\left(\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{y}{b} + \\frac{z}{c}\\right) / 3\\right)^3\n   \\]\n5. Substituting the constraint into the inequality:\n   \\[\n   V \\leq a b c \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{a b c}{27}\n   \\]\n6. The maximum volume reaches its maximum when:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{y}{b} = \\frac{z}{c} = \\frac{1}{3} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{a}{3}, \\quad y = \\frac{b}{3}, \\quad z = \\frac{c}{3}\n   \\]\n\n   Conclusion.\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\frac{a}{3}, \\frac{b}{3}, \\frac{c}{3}}\n   \\]",

  "prompt": "Given the function $f(x) = |x - 1|$, identify which of the following functions is equal to $f(x)$:\nA: $g(x) = \\frac {|x^{2} - 1|}{|x + 1|}$\nB: $g(x) = \\begin{cases} \\frac {|x^{2} - 1|}{|x + 1|}, & x \\neq -1 \\\\ 2, & x = -1 \\end{cases}$\nC: $g(x) = \\begin{cases} x - 1, & x > 0 \\\\ 1 - x, & x \\leq 0 \\end{cases}$\nD: $g(x) = x - 1$",
  "answer": "To determine whether two functions are equal, we must examine both their correspondence (rules of the function) and their domain (set of all possible inputs).\n\nFor the function $f(x) = |x - 1|$, the domain is $\\mathbb{R}$ (all real numbers).\n\n**Option A**: The function $g(x) = \\frac {|x^{2} - 1|}{|x + 1|}$ has a domain of $\\{x | x \\neq -1\\}$, excluding $x = -1$. Therefore, its domain is not the same as that of $f(x)$.\n\n**Option B**: Let's analyze the expression given for $g(x)$ and compare it to $f(x)$. When $x \\neq -1$, we can factor the numerator of $g(x)$ to obtain $|x^2 - 1| = |(x + 1)(x - 1)|$. We then have:\n$$\ng(x) = \\frac {|(x + 1)(x - 1)|}{|x + 1|} = |x - 1|,\n$$\nfor $x \\neq -1$. At $x = -1$, the function $g(x)$ is defined to be $2$. Since $f(-1) = |-1 - 1| = | - 2| = 2$, both the corresponding values and the domains of $f(x)$ and this piece of $g(x)$ are identical. Thus, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are equal for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Option C**: The function $g(x)$ as presented has two different expressions based on the value of $x$, but the correspondence with $f(x)$ does not match. Specifically, for $x > 0$, the function should still return a positive result when $x < 1$. Hence, this function is not equal to $f(x)$.\n\n**Option D**: The function $g(x) = x - 1$ is not equal to $f(x)$ because there is no absolute value, and thus, the correspondence for negative values of $x$ would not match $f(x)$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{B}\\]",

  "prompt": "A palindromic number is a number that reads the same when the order of its digits is reversed. What is the difference between the largest and smallest five-digit palindromic numbers that are both multiples of 45?",
  "answer": "To solve the problem, we need to find palindromic numbers that satisfy two conditions: they are multiples of 45 and are five digits long. We then need to find the difference between the largest and smallest such numbers.\n\n1. **Understanding the conditions for a number to be a multiple of 45:**\n    - A number is a multiple of 45 if and only if it is a multiple of both 5 and 9.\n    - For a number to be a multiple of 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5.\n    - For a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9.\n\n2. **Identifying constraints for a five-digit palindromic number:**\n    - A five-digit palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards, and hence has the form $abcba$.\n    - Given that the last digit must be 5 (because it cannot end in 0 for a palindromic number), the first digit also must be 5.\n\n3. **Form of the five-digit palindromic number that is a multiple of 45:**\n    - The number will have the form $5ab5a$.\n\n4. **Finding the largest palindromic number:**\n    - To maximize the number, we set $a = 9$ and choose $b$ that makes the sum of the digits a multiple of 9.\n    - The sum of the digits of the number $59b95$ is $5 + 9 + b + 9 + 5 = 28 + b$.\n    - We need $28 + b$ to be a multiple of 9. The smallest positive integer $b$ that accomplishes this is $b = 8$ (since $28 + 8 = 36$, and 36 is a multiple of 9).\n    - Thus, the largest five-digit palindromic number is $59895$.\n\n5. **Finding the smallest palindromic number:**\n    - To minimize the number, we set $a = 0$ and choose $b$ that makes the sum of the digits a multiple of 9.\n    - The sum of the digits of the number $50b05$ is $5 + 0 + b + 0 + 5 = 10 + b$.\n    - We need $10 + b$ to be a multiple of 9. The smallest positive integer $b$ that achieves this is $b = 8$ (since $10 + 8 = 18$, and 18 is a multiple of 9).\n    - Thus, the smallest five-digit palindromic number is $50805$.\n\n6. **Calculating the difference between the largest and smallest numbers:**\n    \\[\n    59895 - 50805 = 9090\n    \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe difference between the largest and smallest five-digit palindromic numbers that are multiples of 45 is \\(\\boxed{9090}\\).",
