{"prompt": "What is the derivative of x^2 + 3x + 2?", "answer": "The derivative of x^2 + 3x + 2 is 2x + 3. Using the power rule: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1), so d/dx(x^2) = 2x, d/dx(3x) = 3, and d/dx(2) = 0. Therefore, the derivative is 2x + 3.", "system": "You are a mathematics tutor providing step-by-step solutions."}
{"prompt": "Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13", "answer": "To solve 2x + 5 = 13: 1) Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 8. 2) Divide both sides by 2: x = 4. Therefore, x = 4.", "system": "You are a mathematics tutor providing step-by-step solutions."}
{"prompt": "What is the integral of sin(x) dx?", "answer": "The integral of sin(x) dx is -cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. This follows from the fact that the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), so the antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x).", "system": "You are a mathematics tutor providing step-by-step solutions."}
