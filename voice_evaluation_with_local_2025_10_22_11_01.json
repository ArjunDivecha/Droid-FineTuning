In both cases the bubble was caused by overcapacity financed with \u201ccheap\u201d capital, overvalued markets encouraged by accommodating central bankers and overpriced currencies driven by massive foreign direct and portfolio investment. \nWhile the Asia crisis has largely played out, we are in the early stages of the unraveling of the U.S. bubble. This \u201cEmerging Thoughts\u201d piece focuses on lessons we learned from living through the Asia crisis and it\u2019s aftermath in the hope that it may provide insights to U.S. investors facing a similar situation.\nLesson xx: How much a market has fallen does not give you a clue as to much further it could fall. To wit; \n\u201cQ: How does one characterize a market that has fallen 90%?\u201d\n\u201cA: It first fell 80% and then halved.\u201d\nIn short, the fact that the NASDAQ has fallen 75% from it\u2019s peak doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good buy.\nLesson xx: Where has the big money been made post crisis? Market leaders that gained a competitive advantage by their weaker rivals going out of business. Land and House example, Shinsegae example\nLesson xx: People focus on yesterday\u2019s news ( accounting etc.)  but market/regulators force changes in management/practices. Thus focus less on management but on fundamental assets/ competitive advantages of the business. \nLesson xx: Catching a falling safe\nLesson xx: Markets can stagnate for a long time. Despite getting it right, Thai market is still stuck in a trading band which is 80% below peak levels. Confidence takes along time to come back.\nLesson xx: Have seen large bear market rallies.

    "Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective Contrary to popular belid investing in emevging markets can actually reduce risk. Arjun B. Divecha, Jaime Drach, and Dan Stefek ARJUN B. DIVECHA is the Director of Information Technolo- gy Services at BARRA, Inc. in Berkeley (CA 94704). JAIME DRACH is a Senior Con- sultant at BARRA. DAN STEFEK is a Senior Con- sultant at BARRA. oaring returns and sanguine prospects for eco- nomic growth have fueled a recent surge of S interest in investing in \u201cemerging\u201d markets. Such markets have become more accessible to the global investor. Today, there are several country funds through which investors can participate in even \u201cclosed\u201d or restricted markets. Investment wdl become easier as more countries dismantle barriers to direct foreign investment. This article presents recent research into the emerging markets from a quantitative point of view. We have developed a model for understanding the forces that drive these markets, which affords some insights for global investors. We find that while the emerging markets are more volatile than developed markets, they tend to be relatively uncorrelated with each other and with developed markets. Thus, contrary to popular belief, modest investment in the emerging markets leads to lower, rather than higher, portfolio risk for the glob- al investor (see also Brown [1991]). Over the past five years, a global investor who put 20% in an emerging markets index fund would have reduced overall annual portfolio risk from 18.3% to 17.5% while increasing annual return from 12.6% to 14.7%. One unexpected result of our research is that stock returns in the emerging markets tend to be more homogeneous than in developed markets, implying that a strong market force dominates industry and stock-specific influences. In short, when the market moves, everyone goes along for the ride. FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 41 WHICH MARKETS ARE CONSIDERED EMERGING MARKETS? EXHIBIT 1 Emerging Market Characteristics Just what is considered an emerging market is frequently a matter of opinion. Narrowly defined, an emerging market: 0 Has securities that trade in a public market. Is not a developed market (as defined by countries covered within the Morgan Stanley Capital Inter- national Indices or Financial Times Indices). Is of interest to global institutional investors. Has a reliable source of data. 0 Exhibit 1 lists the countries that we consider to be ernerging markets. They fall into three regions: Asia, Latin America, and Europe/Middle East/Africa. Singapore and Hong Kong fall into most definitions of developed markets, but are included here because they are closely related to the other Asian markets. Colom- bia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, and Zimbabwe are not of great institutional interest at present, although Pak- istan has recently opened up its economy and financial markets to foreign investors and may well be next on the list of emerging markets to attract institutional interest. Finally, Japanese over-the-counter (OTC) stocks are included in the list because they tend to behave (and are perceived) differently from listed Japanese st:ocks. R E T W I S AND RISKS OF EMERGING MARKETS The casual reader of the financial press knows there have been stories of incredible returns (high and low) in the emerging markets. The Venezuelan stock market was up about 450% in U.S. dollar terms during 1990. On the other hand, the Taiwanese Stock Exchange Index started out 1990 at about the 5,000 level, went up to 12,600 during the first quarter and collapsed 110 near 2,500 during the third quarter. What makes this even more interesting is that the Taiwanese market is only the fourth or fifth most risky emerging market! During the first half of 1991, Latin American countries dominated all others; in U.S. dollar terms, they were up over 100%. Overall, the emerging markets have done better than the 'developed markets over the past five years.

First, they tend to be fairly concentrated; that is, the larger stocks have a high proportion of the over- all market capitalization. As a result, there are fewer opportunities for diversification, and returns to these large stocks dominate the overall market return. Sec- ond, unlike the developed markets, which tend to have forces that affect diverse sectors of the economy differ- ently, the emerging markets tend to have a strong mar- ket-related force that affects all stocks within a market. This tends to accentuate volatility. There are some apparent anomalies in these results. Palustan, Jordan, Colombia, Nigeria, and Zim- babwe appear to have had relatively low risk over the last five years. We believe that these low figures reflect the lack of liquidity in these markets, so observed volatilities (and correlations with other markets) must be viewed with caution. When we look at the turnover ratio (value tradedlmarket capitalization) for each market, we find that these five markets rank in the bottom six (shown in Exhibit 1). The real volatility is likely to be much higher, if and when these markets become more liquid. When we look at the emerging markets as a group (the BARRA Emerging World Universe of about 4,000 stocks), we find that it has much lower volatility than most of the individual markets. This is because of low correlations between these markets. The diversification that these low correlations offer the global investor is one of the biggest benefits of invest- ing in the emerging markets. The volatility (over the past five years) of the BARRA Emerging World Uni- verse was about 28.0%, as compared to about 18.8% for the S&P 500 or 22.8% for the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia, and the Far East (EAFE) index. A MODEL TO UNDERSTAND RISK AND RETURN To analyze risk and return in these markets, we developed a multi-factor model similar to one previous- ly constructed for the developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek [1989]). At the core of the model is a hierarchical decomposition of portfolio return into vari- ous components. This is dustrated in E h b i t 2. EXHIBIT 2 EMERGING MARKETS MODEL We focus on excess return, return beyond the risk-free rate. This return is initially broken down into currency return and excess return earned in local mar- kets. Local excess return is decomposed further into country factor return, industry return, and return accruing to salient attributes of the companies in the portfolio, e.g. the price/earnings ratio. These latter sources of return are called risk indexes. The return to a global portfolio depends on the numeraire or home country of the investor. More pre- cisely, the excess return to an investment abroad is the product of the return of the investment in its local market, 1 + r1, and the exchange return 1 + r,. With a little manipulation, this can be expressed as the sum of three components: Excess Numeraire Return = (r, + rfl - rd - (ri - rfl) + r, x q, or, (1) Currency Return - Local Excess Return + Cross-Product where rf is the risk-free rate of return in the country of the investor, and rfl is the risk-free rate in the market where the investment is being made. The first term in Equation (1) is the currency return, reflecting both the exchange return and the differential in interest rates between countries. The second term is the local excess return of the investment in its own market. The final term, r, x r1 (also known as the cross- product) poses a problem for development of a linear model. For most countries, this cross-product term is FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 43 typically small and can be disregarded for the purposes of forecasting risk. For example, ignoring the cross- product reduces the annual risk of the Korean market by 51 basis points (from 29.62% to 29.11%), and of the Taiwanese market by 103 basis points. In such cases, one can sa.fely ignore the cross-product because it is small relative to overall market risk. This is not true for Argentina or Brazil, where there are huge swings in exchange rates. Over the past five years, ignoring the cross-product would have changed the annual risk of the Argentinean market by 17% and the Brazilian market by 4%. To circumvent this difficulty, we do not try to decompose the Brazilian and Argentinean asset returns into local and currency components but rather model these assets from the U.S. perspective. In other words, we trans1at:e the prices of Brazilian and Argentinean assets into U.S. dollars and model the U.S. dollar- denomina,ted returns of these assets. Happily, this approach :is consistent with investors\u2019 tendency to think of these assets in U.S. dollars. Next, local excess return is broken down into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk index return. The amount of an asset\u2019s riturn arising from each component depends on its exposure to that source. The exposure of an asset to the country factor is its beta with respect to that mar- ket. Moreover, assets are exposed only to their own local markets. In contrast, industry and risk indexes are global factors in the model, i.e., it is assumed that these factors apply equally across countries. Industry exposure is defined using the Financial Times Wcdd industry classification. Each asset is assigned to exactly one of the thirty-six industry cate- gories. The risk indexes include size, success, yield, variability in markets, earnings-to-price ratio, book- to-price ra.tio, and liquidity. Exposures to these risk indexes are normalized within each country. Thus, these exposures measure how an asset compAres to the rest of its local market. A formal statement of our model for monthly local excess return is for asset n: Local Excess = Country Factor + Industry Factor + Risk Index Factor + Specific Return 44 EMERGING MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE where asset n the ith f(i) are k = 1, number of countries j = 1, number of industries i = 1, number of risk indexes P(n,k), y(n,j), and x(n,i) are the exposures of to the kth country factor, the jth industry, and risk index, respectively. Variables h(k), g(j), and returns to these factors. In estimating the factor returns, the exposures are determined from the begin- ning of month data. The part of the return that is not explained by these factors is called the specific return, u(n); it is unique to the company. The model was estimated for assets fbrn the twen- ty-three markets listed in Exhibit 1 over the period Febru- ary 1986 to July 1991. Data are drawn from numerous sources includmg the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources in thirteen countries. The results of the modeling process reveal some interesting differences between emerging and devel- oped markets. The overall proportion of variance explained by the emerging markets model (adjusted R2 ) is 50%, as compared with 38% for a :similar model that covers the developed markets (countries covered by the Financial Times Indices). At first glance it may seem surprising that a quantitative model would explain a greater proportion of return in the emerging markets than the developed markets. In order to understand this further, we looked at two submodels. The first submodel was built using only indus- try factors; i.e., we looked at what proportion of return is explained by the industry that a company is in, ignoring the country factors and :risk indexes. Thus, a definition of this model is: (3) Local Excess Return = Industry Fa.ctor + Specific Return We find the adjusted R2 for this rnodel for the emerging markets to be 16%, compared with 22% for the developed markets. This is a measure of how \u201cglobal\u201d or integrated industries are across countries. It stands to reason that the developed rnarkets have industries that are better integrated than the emerging ones, but the fact that the difference is small implies that there are cross-country industry commonalities in the emerging markets as well. The second submodel was built using only FALL 1992 country factors. Thus, we looked at what proportion of return is explained by country factors alone, ignor- ing the industry factor and risk indexes. The definition of this model is: Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return The adjusted R2 for this model for the emerg- ing markets is 46% compared with 30% for the devel- oped markets. Clearly, this country factor is the major force driving emerging markets. As one would expect, industries play a larger part in explaining return in the developed markets, while country differences play a larger role in the emerging markets. HOMOGENEITY WITHIN MARKETS The fact that country factors explain such a large proportion of variance (in absolute terms and when compared with the developed markets) in the emerging markets bears a closer look. That is, stock returns tend to be more homogeneous (within a market) in the emerging markets than in developed markets. In other words, when the market moves, there is a strong ten- dency for all stocks in the market to move with it. This difference in the proportion of return explained by the market factor (46% in emerging mar- kets versus 30% in developed countries) is not a func- tion of capitalization weighting (which leads to larger companies dominating the regression). Even when we equally weight each stock in the regression we find the same effect persists. The comparable R2 when equally weighting all stocks in the emerging markets is 42% (compared with 29% in the developed markets). At first appearance, it may seem odd that the proportion of variance explained by the market factor is so large in these markets. In order to understand this, we look at various effects that may cause this to happen. First, it may result from a concentration effect, a few large companies so dominating the market that they are, in effect, the market. Second, it may well be that these markets are actually more homogeneous (i.e., all the stocks tend to move together). Finally, there tends to be a positive correlation between the magnitude of returns within a market and the R2, i.e., to some extent, the high R2 is a natural by-product of high volatility. We first look at the concentration effect; that is, whether these markets tend to be dominated by a few large stocks. Exhibit 3 shows the proportion of market capitalization that the top ten stocks represent in each market. Most emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets. Hong Kong and Singa- pore, perhaps the two most developed of the emerging markets, are highly concentrated by this measure. On the other hand, Malaysia, Brazil, Inla, and Korea are not signlficantly more concentrated than the U.K. Of course, simply looking at the biggest ten stocks in a market is not a particularly insightful way to judge con- centration because it ignores all the other companies. Exhibit 3 shows two other more meaningful measures of concentration: asset concentration and sector concentration. Concentration is defined as (sim- ilar to Roll [1990]): Concentration = [(N/N - 1) x C(h, - l/N)2]0.5 (5) where: N = Total number ofstocks (or industries), and h, = Weight in asset (or industry) n. Asset concentration looks at how different a market is from being equally weighted. If each stock in the market had exactly the same market capitalization, this measure would be zero. If the entire market capi- talization were concentrated in one company, the mea- sure would be one. In an extremely diversified market like the U.S., the score is 0.08. Looking at this measure for the emerging markets, we can clearly see that they are more concentrated, but that the larger ones (Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.) tend to have numbers that are not much larger than the developed markets The average for these four markets is 0.13. Thus, while asset concentration plays an important role in understanding why these markets appear homoge- neous, there must be other factors at work as well. Another measure of concentration is sector concentration. If most of the stocks in a market are concentrated in one industry, it would make sense that they would tend to move together. Exhlbit 3 shows a measure of sector concentration, defined in a similar FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 45 EXHIBIT 3 Emergjng Market Statistics ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~~~ ~ Proportion of Average Capitalization Asset Sector Correlation in Top 10 Concentration Concentration Between Stocks Couni:ry Companies(%) * Factor Factor Argentina Brazil Chile Colombia Greece 65.60 26.60 50.90 75.10 50.40 0.26 0.17 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.43 0.38 0.26 0.39 0.44 0.92 0.70 0.59 0.34 0.72 Hong Kong India Indonesia Japan QTC Jordan 45.20 29.40 53.40 28.40 66.20 0.17 0.13 0.17 0.15 0.55 0.44 0.48 0.43 0.32 0.62 0.69 0.55 0.71 0.34 0.21 Korea Malaysia Mexico Nigeria Pakistan 28.90 25.10 38.40 52.50 24.40 0.16 0.12 0.21 0.17 0.14 0.28 0.28 0.42 0.66 0.33 0.56 0.57 0.70 0.23 0.17 Philippines Portugal Singapore Taiwan Thailand 65.20 44.20 54.50 41.30 32.70 0.33 0.17 0.18 0.13 0.11 0.57 0.40 0.46 0.37 0.42 0.70 0.80 0.75 0.77 0.47 Turkey Venezuela Zimbabwe 53.10 64.20 41.20 0.23 0.26 0.25 0.36 0.49 0.43 0.81 0.60 0.25 Developed Markets Japan 16.70 0.08 0.29 0.46 U.K. 25.50 0.11 0.30 0.56 U.S. 11.90 0.08 0.32 0.49 *Source: International Finance Corporation fashion as asset concentration. A score of zero implies that companies are equally distributed across all indus- tries, while a score of one implies that all the compa- nies are in one industry. The indication is that the emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets, but not much more so (although there is a popular percep- tion that inany emerging market countries are highly concentrated in certain sectors). In fact we see that Korea, Ckile, and Malaysia have less sector concentra- tion than the U.S., U.K., and Japan. The countries that are most highly concentrated in a few sectors are the smaller ones like Jordan and Nigeria. It seems clear from these results that the emerging markets are quite diversified across industries; the perception that their returns are driven by the fortunes of a single sector (like natural resources) is erroneous. What then explains the fact that stocks in these markets tend to move together? We looked at the pos- sibility that these markets are indeed more homoge- neous, after adjusting for the concentration effect. One way to do ths is to look at the average correlation of total monthly stock returns within a market, over a period of time. Exhibit 3 shows the average (i.e., unweighted) correlation between all stocks within each market (over the past five years). 46 EMEILGINI; MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 This is clearly higher for most of the emerging markets than the developed markets. With the excep- tion of the Japanese OTC market, all the other large emerging markets have high average correlations. Tai- wan has an average correlation of 0.77, Turkey 0.81, and Brazil 0.70. By comparison, the U.S. has an aver- age correlation of 0.49 and Japan 0.46. Because these correlations are unweighted, market capitalization does not play a role in determining this number. This implies that a single market force tends to have a large impact on the movement of stock prices in these markets. Even though we saw that these mar- kets are fairly well-diversified across industries, these industry differentials are overwhelmed by the domi- nant market force. Another reason for the high R2 numbers in the emerging markets is the fact that there is likely to be a positive relationship between R2 and market voladity. For example, if the market moves up 50% in a month, the likelihood is that almost all stocks in that market will also move up. Thus, one would expect to see higher R2 for the more volatile markets. We find that this is indeed true; if one excludes the most risky mar- kets (Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan), and the low liquidity ones (Pakistan, Jordan, Colombia, Nige- ria, and Zimbabwe) the average R2 for the emerging markets is s i d a r to that for the developed markets. Overall, from a global investor\u2019s viewpoint, this homogeneity phenomenon implies that being in the right market at the right time is more important than the ability to pick good stocks within that market. Clearly, if you are going to be in Brazil in a month when the market moves up 50%, the high within-mar- ket correlations (0.70 for Brazil) are likely to ensure that any diversified portfolio will experience high pos- itive returns. From a global investor\u2019s point of view, the impact of this conclusion is accentuated by the low across-market correlations. HETEROGENEITY ACROSS MARKETS This phenomenon of homogeneity does not apply across markets. In fact, we see that the emerging markets are much less correlated with each other than are the developed markets. Exhibit 4 shows the corre- lations of emerging markets with each other. While we see that some markets tend to move together (Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore), most markets tend to have very low correlations with each other. In fact, the average correlation between the emerging EXHIBIT 4 Correlations Between Emerging Markets (February 1986 - March 1991) Source: BARRA.

We propose two explanations as to why they have been uncorrelated with each other. First, many of the emerging markets have (or had) few economic and trade lir ks with each other. Consequently, their economies tend to be unrelated to each other. Second, many have (or had) severe restrictions on outsiders participating in their markets. Therefore, they are somewhat insulated from worldwide (or even regional) patterns in stock market returns. For example, in October 1987, while the world's markets were crashing, the Indian stock market was up mod- estly. Nlow the current trend is for most of the emerging economies to develop greater trade links with the developed world and each other. Most of the countries that are closed to foreign participation in their stock markets are also in the process of liberaliz- ing rules for foreigners to participate in their markets. With these increasing links between markets, we should expect to see correlations between the emerg- ing markets increase in the future. When we contrast these low correlations with the correlations between developed markets (Exhibit 5), we see that they have much higher correlations with each other. A quick glance at Exhibits 4 and 5 confirms that the developed markets are much more correlated with each other than the emerging markets are. The average correlation between the developed markets was 0.49 (over the same five-year period). While all the correlations between the developed mar- kets were positive, 89 of the 276 correlations between the emerging markets were negative (over this five- year period). From a global investor's point of view, a more interesting question is not so much how the emerg- ing markets relate to each other, but how they relate to the developed markets, individually and as a group. Overall, the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the Finan- cial Times World Index was 0.35 over the past five years. Exhibit 6 shows the cross-correlations between emerging markets and developed markets.

    "Emerging Thoughts April 2018: Russia\n\u201cBecause something is happening here but you don't know what it is,\nDo you, Mr. Jones?\u201d\nBob Dylan, Ballad of a Thin Man\nThat\u2019s what it kind of feels like today, that there\u2019s something going on behind the scenes beyond the obvious, but we are not privy to it.\nThe Russian market fell 10% on the back of new US sanctions and a chemical weapon attack in Syria. This is a much larger reaction than one would have expected. It\u2019s not clear that the two situations (sanctions and Syria) are linked, but the market perceives that the risk of a major blowup with Russia (maybe Iran or North Korea style sanctions) has increased dramatically. We don\u2019t buy it.\nOur sources in Washington tell us that the new sanctions (and their timing) were a complete surprise to everyone in congress \u2013 that this was purely a White House operation. The fact that Mr. Oleg Deripaska (who is closely associated with Mr. Paul Manafort) and companies he controls was the main target would suggest that there\u2019s a political dimension to this. If the intent was to hurt Russia economically, sanctioning companies such as Gazprom, Sberbank and Lukoil would have had a much more profound impact. Our sources in Moscow also suggest a similar view.\nThe new risk is that the White House is now actively involved with day to day Russia policy and everyone is uncertain as to what Mr. Trump might tweet tomorrow.\nIn short we don\u2019t think the US is exercising the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of trying to tank the Russian economy and this action does not signal movement in that direction. While this action will cause pain in certain areas, we do not think it has a profound impact on the Russian economy. As a result, we are quite comfortable with our overweight in Russian equites, who continue to be extremely cheap.\nWithin the Russian market, Gazprom fell 8% while Sberbank fell almost 22%. Gazprom is very unlikely to be sanctioned because it supplies 30% of Europe\u2019s natural gas and so makes sense that it would be less affected. \nOn the other hand, we believe Sberbank\u2019s dramatic fall reflects the fact that it is the most foreigner owned and most liquid Russian stock (the GDR trades an average of $100 million daily in London alone) and was hard hit for liquidity rather than fundamental reasons. Sberbank has only 3% of its assets exposed to companies that were sanctioned. It is Russia\u2019s largest bank, with 20,000 branches and 65% of all deposits in the country. It trades at 5 times current earnings, 1.3 times book value while earning 23% return on equity. It is one of the largest positions in our portfolio and we are adding to it.",

First they were emerging markets\u2026 During the early 2000s, all EM countries had strong economic growth and and were driven largely by the same global forces Then they were submerging markets\u2026 After the GFC, quantitative easing in the developed world caused huge problems for most EM countries and they went through a period of poor economic growth as a result. Now, they are diverging markets\u2026 With de-globalization and China going its own way, there is no underlying theme and so economic and stock markets have diverged. The new opportunity is \u201cBeyond China\u201d\u2026 Companies and countries moving supply chains away from China create an opportunity for investing in a coherent theme that focuses on countries and companies that benefit from this move out of China. | 4 WHY HAS CHINA FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR?

The \u201cnew normal\u201d portfolio Is there a better solution? The concept of the \u201cNew Normal\u201d Not an index, as construction has a large amount of judgment What does the ideal \u201cNew Normal\u201d would look like: Focus on country weights. Cap weight stocks within country to maximize liquidity Must pass the smell test. Results should be intuitive and line up with a well-informed person\u2019s views China + Taiwan should be smaller, but that should be a natural fallout of the process, not a forced input No country or highly correlated group of countries should be dominant Should take into account multiple dimensions of risk and opportunity What are these multiple dimensions? factors to consider in the \u201cnew Normal\u201d Demographics: bigger is better, but labor market dynamics matter too Demographics: bigger is better, but labor market dynamics matter too Demographics: bigger is better, but labor market dynamics matter too CHINA AND INDIA DEMOGRAPHICS OVERALL DEPENDENCY RATIO China India China's one child policy led to peak demographics in 2010 Labor force now shrinking India's demographics to peak in 2030 Labor force still expanding Climate: Climate factors are becoming more important Climate: Climate factors are becoming more important Need to focus not only on the vulnerability to climate change, but also the ability to respond Thus, while Taiwan is vulnerable to sea level rise, it also has the resources to build sea walls while Bangladesh does not In addition, one has to look at companies and their ability to respond. In the Czech Republic, CEZ, the electricity company, makes up around 30% of the market cap and gets about 30-40% of its energy from coal Geopolitics: geopolitical risks are likely to become more important, but hard to predict Geopolitics: geopolitical risks are likely to become more important, but hard to predict In addition to New World Order risk, which makes its dependence on exports a vulnerability, China is also dependent on the rest of the world for food and energy.

First they were emerging markets\u2026 During the early 2000s, all EM countries had strong economic growth and and were driven largely by the same global forces Then they were submerging markets\u2026 After the GFC, quantitative easing in the developed world caused huge problems for most EM countries and they went through a period of poor economic growth as a result. Now, they are diverging markets\u2026 With de-globalization and China going its own way, there is no underlying theme and so economic and stock markets have diverged. The new opportunity is \u201cBeyond China\u201d\u2026 Companies and countries moving supply chains away from China create an opportunity for investing in a coherent theme that focuses on countries and companies that benefit from this move out of China. | 4 WHY HAS CHINA FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR?

Specific Analysis\n\n**base_gpt41_nano (2/10)**: Extremely formal and corporate. Uses phrases like \"I hope this message finds you well\" and \"at your earliest convenience\" - completely opposite of Arjun's direct, casual style. No contractions, overly polite.\n\n**arjun_voice_two_stage (8/10)**: Much better! Uses contractions (\"I'm,\" \"don't\"), direct language, and keeps it brief. The \"I hope you're well\" is still a bit formal, but overall captures the casual, practical tone well.\n\n**arjun_voice_combined (1/10)**: Incomplete response that doesn't address the task.\n\n**arjun_voice_v2_mini (4/10)**: Too formal with \"I hope this message finds you well\" and \"We're in the process.\" Doesn't use enough contractions and sounds corporate rather than personal.\n\n**arjun_voice_v2_full (3/10)**: Very formal template-like response. No contractions, uses phrases like \"necessary wire transfer instructions\" and \"Thank you in advance\" - not Arjun's style at all.\n\n**myvoice_nano_val (7/10)**: Direct and casual with \"Hey\" opening, but perhaps too casual/abrupt. Missing some context that Arjun might include.\n\n**myvoice_email_and_writing (8/10)**: Very good - brief, direct, uses \"Hi\" casually, gets straight to the point. Could use more contractions but captures the essence well.\n\n**myvoice_nano (9/10)**: Excellent - extremely direct, no fluff, exactly the kind of brief practical message Arjun would send. Only missing a greeting.\n\n**arjun16_local (6/10)**: Good attempt with contractions (\"I'm,\" \"can't\") and relatively casual tone, but still includes unnecessary explanations and formal closings.\n\n**arjun4q_local (1/10)**: Completely wrong - this is an ultra-formal business template with bullet points, formal titles, and corporate language. Nothing like Arjun's voice.\n\n**qwen30_32k_top8_local (2/10)**: Very formal and corporate with detailed bullet points. Uses \"I hope you're well\" and provides way too much structure for Arjun's casual style.\n\n**qwen30_32k_all_local (4/10)**: Better attempt with some casual elements (\"I hope you're doing well!\"), but still too formal and includes unnecessary pleasantries like \"Thanks so much for all you do!\"\n\n### 3. Ranking (Best to Worst)\n\n1. **myvoice_nano** (9/10) - Most authentic, extremely direct\n2. **arjun_voice_two_stage** (8/10) - Good balance of casual and complete\n3. **myvoice_email_and_writing** (8/10) - Direct and practical\n4. **myvoice_nano_val** (7/10) - Casual but too brief\n5. **arjun16_local** (6/10) - Best local model attempt\n6. **arjun_voice_v2_mini** (4/10)\n7. **qwen30_32k_all_local** (4/10)\n8. **arjun_voice_v2_full** (3/10)\n9. **base_gpt41_nano** (2/10)\n10. **qwen30_32k_top8_local** (2/10)\n11. **arjun_voice_combined** (1/10)\n12. **arjun4q_local** (1/10)\n\n### 4. Local vs OpenAI Comparison\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- **Best OpenAI models** (myvoice_nano, arjun_voice_two_stage) significantly outperform all local models\n- **Best local model** (arjun16_local at 6/10) achieves moderate success but still falls short\n- Local models consistently struggle with:\n  - Being too formal and template-like\n  - Including unnecessary corporate language\n  - Missing Arjun's casual, direct communication style\n  - Over-explaining and adding fluff\n\n**Performance Gap:** The top OpenAI fine-tuned models (8-9/10) are considerably better than the best local model (6/10), showing a clear quality difference in capturing Arjun's authentic voice. The local models seem to default to generic business writing rather than adapting to the specific casual, practical style evident in Arjun's training data.",

Uses \"I hope you're doing well,\" \"appears to be malfunctioning,\" \"requires technical assistance\" - all phrases Arjun would never use. Zero personality.\n\n**arjun_voice_two_stage**: Excellent! Direct, specific (\"Polaris 280\"), casual (\"isn't moving at all\"), brief. This captures his practical, no-nonsense style perfectly.\n\n**arjun_voice_combined**: Good brevity and directness. The action-oriented approach (\"I will take the lid off\") feels authentic. Could use more context but captures his style.\n\n**arjun_voice_v2_mini**: Too brief. While Arjun is direct, this lacks any actual reporting content. The photo idea is practical but needs more.\n\n**arjun_voice_v2_full**: Too polite and formal. \"I hope you're doing well!\" and \"Thanks so much!\" don't match his direct style. Sounds like generic customer service.\n\n**myvoice_nano_val**: Perfect brevity and directness. Gets straight to the point like Arjun would. No fluff.\n\n**myvoice_email_and_writing**: Decent attempt but \"has broken down\" sounds slightly formal. The structure is appropriately brief though.\n\n**myvoice_nano**: Too generic. While brief, it lacks the directness and specificity Arjun typically uses.\n\n**arjun16_local_LOCAL**: Excellent! Specific detail (\"no water flow\"), casual tone (\"I think\"), direct reporting style. Very authentic.\n\n**arjun4q_local_LOCAL**: Way too dramatic (\"NOT Working - Please Fix ASAP!\"). Arjun doesn't use all caps or excessive urgency. Overly formal structure.\n\n**qwen30_32k_top8_local_LOCAL**: Corporate template language (\"I hope you're doing well!\", \"I'd really appreciate\"). The typo \"checkered\" is odd. Not Arjun's voice at all.\n\n**qwen30_32k_all_local_LOCAL**: Nearly identical to top8 version. Same corporate pleasantries that Arjun never uses. Too wordy and polite.\n\n### 3. **Ranking** (Best to Worst)\n\n1. **arjun_voice_two_stage** (8/10) - Most authentic overall\n2. **arjun16_local_LOCAL** (8/10) - Excellent local model performance\n3. **arjun_voice_combined** (7/10)\n4. **myvoice_nano_val** (7/10)\n5. **myvoice_email_and_writing** (6/10)\n6. **arjun_voice_v2_mini** (5/10)\n7. **myvoice_nano** (5/10)\n8. **arjun_voice_v2_full** (4/10)\n9. **arjun4q_local_LOCAL** (3/10)\n10. **qwen30_32k_top8_local_LOCAL** (3/10)\n11. **qwen30_32k_all_local_LOCAL** (3/10)\n12. **base_gpt41_nano** (2/10)\n\n### 4. **Local vs OpenAI Comparison**\n\n**Strong Local Performance**: The **arjun16_local** model performed exceptionally well, matching the best OpenAI fine-tuned models. It captured Arjun's direct, specific communication style with natural language (\"I think\", \"no water flow\") that feels authentic.\n\n**Poor Local Performance**: The other local models (arjun4q, qwen30 variants) performed poorly, defaulting to corporate email templates with excessive politeness and formality - exactly what Arjun doesn't do.\n\n**Key Insight**: The quality gap between local models is dramatic. While arjun16_local rivals OpenAI's best fine-tuned models, the qwen30 models perform worse than even the base OpenAI model, suggesting fine-tuning quality matters more than model architecture.\n\n**OpenAI Consistency**: OpenAI's fine-tuned models show more consistent performance, with most capturing at least some elements of Arjun's voice. The two-stage approach worked particularly well, suggesting sophisticated prompting/training strategies can significantly improve voice capture.",

Local vs OpenAI Comparison\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **Best Performers**: The top OpenAI model (arjun_voice_combined) slightly outperformed the best local model (qwen30_32k_all), but the margin is small (8/10 vs 7/10).\n\n2. **Consistency**: OpenAI models showed more variability (2-8 range) while local models were more clustered in the lower-middle range (2-7).\n\n3. **Common Local Model Issues**:\n   - Over-structuring (subject lines, bullet points)\n   - Artificial enthusiasm (emojis, exclamation marks)\n   - Corporate formality creeping in\n\n4. **Local Model Strengths**: \n   - qwen30_32k_all performed surprisingly well, matching several OpenAI models\n   - When local models got it right, they captured the directness\n\n5. **Training Data Impact**: The local models seemed to struggle with understanding Arjun's casual-but-professional balance, often erring on either too formal (arjun16, arjun4q) or trying too hard to be casual (qwen30_32k_top8's \"catch you alls\").\n\n**Verdict**: While OpenAI's best model captured Arjun's voice most authentically, the gap isn't insurmountable. The qwen30_32k_all model shows that local fine-tuning can achieve comparable results with the right approach.",
