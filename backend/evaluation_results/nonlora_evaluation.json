Performance tables show that GMO\u2019s Emerging Markets fund has added value over every time period through December\u202f31\u202f2001, with gross annualized returns that exceed the benchmark after fees are excluded.  Risk metrics are provided: alpha of 3.11\u202f% (single\u2011factor) versus 5.54\u202f% (multi\u2011factor), tracking error of 4.59\u202f% versus 3.78\u202f%, and information ratios of 0.68 and 1.47 respectively, illustrating the benefit of the multi\u2011factor risk model.\n\nCountry allocation grids (January\u202f2002) reveal a heavy tilt toward \u201ccheap\u201d markets\u2014those with low price\u2011to\u2011earnings, price\u2011to\u2011book, and low currency\u2011shock vulnerability\u2014consistent with the firm\u2019s value\u2011orientation.

The timeline from 1990 to 2001 illustrates how the fund moved from high\u2011risk to low\u2011risk currency exposure as fundamentals improved, reinforcing the narrative that disciplined risk control yields more consistent returns.\n\nThe presentation also includes a detailed list of the team\u2019s biographies, emphasizing the depth of experience (e.g., Arjun Divecha\u2019s 12\u202fyears at BARRA, Sam Wilderman\u2019s Yale economics background) and the low turnover that the firm touts as a competitive advantage.  Operational staff biographies (Christine Ferrara, Melanie Nason, Caroline Norgeot, Luz Perla) highlight the back\u2011office support that underpins the investment process.\n\nSupplemental materials feature a series of memorable visual metaphors: \u201cDon\u2019t fire until you see the whites of their eyes,\u201d \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself\u2026but it rhymes,\u201d and a slide titled \u201cRobustness vs. Parsimony\u201d that contrasts the use of multiple sub\u2011models with the desire for simple, justifiable models.  The deck concludes with a disclaimer about past performance, a note on the firm\u2019s client base (pension funds, endowments, foundations, international organizations), and contact information for GMO.\n\nThroughout this section the tone remains personal and confident (\u201cWe have exceeded our performance objectives,\u201d \u201cWe overweight countries that are cheap, less vulnerable to currency shocks, set to surprise conventional wisdom\u201d), while the heavy use of quantitative data, performance tables, and risk metrics provides a rich source of data analysis for training purposes.",

      "training_answer": "Everyone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio\u2014through increased investments in emerging markets!\\n\\nModest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk\\nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January 1988 to December 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years\u2014it is true for any five\u2011year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created).\\n\\nThis analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well\u2011diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market\u2011capitalization weights, the right answer?\\n\\nCapitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions\\nThe case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries.\\n\\nIn the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient.\\n\\nIn such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is available to global investors.\\n\\nIf market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\\n\\nIf not market or GDP weights, then what?\\nAnother proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well\u2011understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum\u2011variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight.\\n\\nThe theoretical basis for such a low\u2011volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex\u2011ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex\u2011post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex\u2011ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex\u2011post minimum\u2011variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market\u2011weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex\u2011post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean\u2011variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio.\\n\\nThus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex\u2011ante forecast of the relative return of one vis\u2011a\u2011vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles. Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\\n\\nThis weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds).",

      "training_answer": "The Empire Strikes Back \n1  Bill Parcells, the current coach of the Dallas Cowboys, is famous for having taken a number of poor football teams under his control and making them successful. However, in my opinion, the secret to his success has been fear and intimidation, which works in the short run, but is ultimately counter\u2011productive \u2013 as evidenced by his having to move to a new team every few years.\n\n2\ndecisions about how we invest your money. As I said in my Emerging Thoughts piece on Mr. Putin\u2019s early days in July 2000 (\u201cPutin on the Ritz\u201d), \u201cAs fund managers, we need to be able to distinguish the unpalatable from the unprofitable.\u201d\n\nSo, what are we doing about this situation? Our country selection process has four elements \u2013 three based on objective, quantitative data and one based on our judgment, which represents 10% of the overall assessment of a country.\n\nCurrently, the quantitative parts of the model are quite negative on Russia, with a combined score of -0.9 (which is quite negative). While the market is relatively cheap (based on high oil company profits) our momentum and macroeconomic models are quite negative. This negative score translates into a moderately large underweighting relative to the benchmark.\n\nGiven the risks I\u2019ve talked about, it makes sense that we should have a negative judgment on Russia. If we were to assess a score of -1.0 on our judgment, the overall score for Russia would fall to -1.2 and our underweighting would increase by 1/2 a percent.\n\nWere the quantitative parts of the model to turn positive over the coming months, we would increase our weight in Russia, recognizing that our judgment serves as a drag on how much we buy, but does not override it.\n\nWould we override the entire process and get out of Russia altogether? Yes, in an extreme circumstance. However, these kinds of systemic overrides are few and far between. The last time we chose to get out a country altogether was when we sold all of our Pakistani holdings when the central bank stealthily imposed capital controls in 2001.\n\nWhile events in Russia are causing angst and forcing us to watch the situation very carefully, we are not yet close to having to take extreme measures. It\u2019s time to be afraid, but not very afraid.\n\nauthoritarian regimes tend to fail in the medium to longer term for a very simple reason \u2013 every petty official from the president on down acquires the ability to be capricious or corrupt without fear of consequences, and frequently chooses to use that power to further their own personal interests. We saw proof of this concept in late December when a senior official within the telecommunication ministry tried (but ultimately failed) to levy punitive back taxes on the cellular carrier Vimplecom. It turns out that this official is affiliated with a major shareholder of one of Vimplecom\u2019s competitors.\n\nHowever, internal affairs within Russia are not the only cause for concern. Recent events in Ukraine also raise the prospect that Russia is on a collision course with the West over what it sees as encroachment onto its home turf.\n\nHaving owned and backed the wrong candidate in the recent election, Mr. Putin may be behind by a couple of goals, but make no mistake, it\u2019s only the first period in a game that has no ending. And, if the sordid history of Yukos is any guide, Mr. Putin is not a leader lightly scorned. Given that Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its natural gas (a number that will rise, not fall, in coming years) and that 80% of that gas transits through Ukraine, Russia holds a number of very significant cards in this game.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nEveryone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio\u2014through increased investments in emerging markets!\\n\\nModest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk\\nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January 1988 to December 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years\u2014it is true for any five\u2011year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created).\\n\\nThis analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well\u2011diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market\u2011capitalization weights, the right answer?\\n\\nCapitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions\\nThe case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries.\\n\\nIn the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient.\\n\\nIn such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is avail",
      "training_answer": "able to global investors.\\n\\nIf market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\\n\\nIf not market or GDP weights, then what?\\nAnother proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well\u2011understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum\u2011variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight.\\n\\nThe theoretical basis for such a low\u2011volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex\u2011ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex\u2011post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex\u2011ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex\u2011post minimum\u2011variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market\u2011weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex\u2011post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean\u2011variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio.\\n\\nThus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex\u2011ante forecast of the relative return of one vis\u2011a\u2011vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles. Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\\n\\nThis weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds).",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nWe have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global ri",
      "training_answer": "vals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",

Our country selection process has four elements \u2013 three based on objective, quantitative data and one based on our judgment, which represents 10% of the overall assessment of a country.\n\nCurrently, the quantitative parts of the model are quite negative on Russia, with a combined score of -0.9 (which is quite negative). While the market is relatively cheap (based on high oil company profits) our momentum and macroeconomic models are quite negative. This negative score translates into a moderately large underweighting relative to the benchmark.\n\nGiven the risks I\u2019ve talked about, it makes sense that we should have a negative judgment on Russia. If we were to assess a score of -1.0 on our judgment, the overall score for Russia would fall to -1.2 and our underweighting would increase by 1/2 a percent.\n\nWere the quantitative parts of the model to turn positive over the coming months, we would increase our weight in Russia, recognizing that our judgment serves as a drag on how much we buy, but does not override it.\n\nWould we override the entire process and get out of Russia altogether? Yes, in an extreme circumstance. However, these kinds of systemic overrides are few and far between. The last time we chose to get out a country altogether was when we sold all of our Pakistani holdings when the central bank stealthily imposed capital controls in 2001.\n\nWhile events in Russia are causing angst and forc",

Given that Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its natural gas (a number that will rise, not fall, in coming years) and that 80% of that gas transits through Ukraine, Russia holds a number of very significant cards in this game.

The presentation opens with a metaphorical title, \u201cReading the Xi Leaves,\u201d signalling that the upcoming analysis will interpret President Xi\u2019s policy signals much like a reader deciphers the subtle patterns in tea leaves. The agenda quickly moves to a historical overview of China\u2019s \u201cprincipal contradiction\u201d \u2013 a concept first mentioned by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and formally codified by the Party in 1981. A timeline of contradictions (1948: capitalism vs. socialism; 1956: economic and cultural growth lagging demand; 1958: ideological struggle; 1981: material and cultural needs vs. backward production; 2017: imbalanced development vs. people\u2019s growing desire for a better life) illustrates how the Party\u2019s focus has shifted from pure growth to a more nuanced balance of quality, equity, and strategic security. \n\nThe \u201cChinese Dream\u201d \u2013 national rejuvenation \u2013 is framed as a tantalisingly reachable goal, illustrated with a chart showing China\u2019s GDP as a share of the United States rising from near\u2011zero in the 1980s to roughly 70\u202f% by 2021. Yet the presenter warns that a policy shift is required to sustain this ascent. Xi\u2019s 2017 speech is quoted: \u201cWhat we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people\u2019s ever\u2011growing needs for a better life.\u201d This sets up three strategic objectives: (1) Reduce inequality \u2013 China\u2019s Gini\u2011type inequality is among the world\u2019s highest; (2) Address the demographic time\u2011bomb \u2013 a rapidly ageing population; (3) Prioritise strategic industries \u2013 technology, batteries, semiconductors, and automation to secure supply chains and achieve self\u2011sufficiency. \n\nThe slides then drill into each objective.

A bar chart of factors influencing child\u2011bearing (education cost, housing price, medical expenses, etc.) underscores the social pressures. \n\nStrategic industry priorities are illustrated with a simple table of sectors (batteries, EVs, semiconductors, automation) and the \u201cuseless\u201d activities the Party may curb (gaming, short\u2011video).

He is extremely plugged in with the financial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefit. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions.\n\nIn my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and financial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long\u2011term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital?\n\nOne of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by Edward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high\u2011speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure financial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high\u2011speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high\u2011speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high\u2011speed rail in expansive continental geographies.\n\nIn short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have difficult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years).\n\nThe one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government actually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song). As you may guess, none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profits by investing in telecoms outside of India. This is what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high profits because producers benefitted from shortages.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of bad policy\u2011making (India consistently runs high budget deficits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high\u2011return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefits investors by delivering high return on investment.\n\nNow this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India benefits from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high\u2011cost\u2011of\u2011capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth.\n\nI believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to grow. We already see inflation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High inflation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high\u2011inflation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs.\n\nNevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom\u2011up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state\u2011directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profit\u2011maximizers.\n\nIn the final analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profitability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t focus on growth. Focus on profitability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation \u2013 we are willing to pay a premium for profitability, but not to overpay for it.\n\nCurrent positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring inflation down, a task that is made much harder by the proliferate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of Arjun Divecha and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\n\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, Chart\u202f2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time relative to the index. Historically value stocks trade at a 40\u202f% discount to the index; today they sit at a 34\u202f% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the fifteen\u2011year history for which we have data. The discount fell from a 46\u202f% discount in October\u202f2000 to the current 34\u202f% discount, a period during which value massively out\u2011performed.\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value behaves when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing. If value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Small\u2011cap stocks are the next logical place to look because smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness. Chart\u202f3 shows that the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32\u202f% in October\u202f2000 to just 12\u202f% today. This contraction in both value and small\u2011cap spreads occurred because both segments performed extremely well over the past four years, greatly helping our performance.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first examined \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks \u2013 companies forecast to have the highest earnings growth over the next two years. As expected, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but Chart\u202f4 shows they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group we follow closely is high\u2011quality stocks (Chart\u202f5). In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory would suggest. In emerging markets, quality stocks usually trade at a modest 9\u202f% premium to the market. Right now we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market.\n\nOver the past two years we have been developing a new measure of value that incorporates quality, and we had planned to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model with a \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. Given the current positioning of both",
      "training_answer": "value and quality, we began transitioning to the new model in May\u202f2004.\n\nIn the new model we explicitly adjust a stock\u2019s attractiveness for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio will rise as quality becomes relatively cheap, while the bet on what might be called \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks will fall. It also increases the average size of companies we own \u2013 a welcome change now that small caps are no longer attractive.\n\nOverall, 70\u202f% of our stock\u2011selection process remains value\u2011driven and 30\u202f% momentum\u2011driven. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value; that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\n\nWhen we say our ability to add value is diminished, the appropriate response is not to abandon emerging markets. Valuations for the asset class suggest emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall exposure if you are overweight the asset class, but emerging equities remain among the most attractive asset classes based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s seven\u2011year forecast, and GMO is heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to move money to another emerging manager. However, the contraction of value has not created greater opportunities elsewhere, so switching styles would not be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nClients who have been with us have enjoyed the value and small\u2011cap rally. While we aim to deliver out\u2011performance of about 4\u202f% per year, the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark by 13.1\u202f% in calendar\u2011year\u2011end\u202f2003, after out\u2011performing by 4.7\u202f% in 2002 and 8.1\u202f% in 2001. If the compression of value leads to tougher times in the next couple of years, at least you have already reaped the benefits of that compression.\n\nWe are battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers.

And right now, like in 1998, everybody with half a brain can see that these new technologies are going to be huge. But, unfortunately, there are very few ways to play that glorious future that\u2019s in the near future.\n\nWe all know the story of Levi Strauss & Co. during the California Gold Rush \u2013 the equipment suppliers that made money in that bubble.\n\nAnd so we see Cisco and Nvidia today in a similar vein. \n\nBut once the technology starts to be used to actually change the world, other companies are major beneficiaries (like Amazon, Google etc.) and the equipment suppliers are correctly seen as commodity producers with low margins as competition seeps in.\n\nAnd so it is today. Here\u2019s a chart of Cisco vs Nvidia starting 18 months before the top of the tech bubble on a similar time and return scale.\n\nAre we now at the top for Nvidia? That\u2019s unknowable.\n\nAs my colleague Jeremey Grantham likes to say, trying to figure out the top of a bubble is like charting the path of a feather in a hurricane. You have no idea as to how far or how high it will go. There is only one thing you know with certainty. It will hit the ground.\n\nAnd so it was with Cisco\u2026 \n\nIf you bought it at the top - almost 25 years later, you\u2019re still losing money.\n\n\n\nSo will Nvidia follow suit? Inevitably.\n\nWhat I predict is that sometime in the next 12 months, we will see the peak. And you\u2019re a fool if you think you can time that event exactly.\n\nMy advice is to sell 1/12th of your Nvidia holding now and another 1/12th every month for the next 12 months irrespective of what the stock does. That way, if I\u2019m right that the top will be in the next 12 months, you will have got out near the top. And save yourself a bunch of sleepless nights.",

As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deli",
      "training_answer": "ver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",

Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest.

Does that mean cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount two years ago and value worked very well for country selection since then. By contrast, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (the latter half of the Asian crisis) cheap countries suffered their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next twelve months.\n\nWhat this means, in our view, is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (45\u202f% weight in our country\u2011assessment model), it is not the only metric we use. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form the remaining 55\u202f% and we have no evidence that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. Our work on currency vulnerability also shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking\u2011error of around 8\u202f%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking the tracking\u2011error down from 8\u202f% to about 6\u202f%. Consequently, our current overweight of Brazil will fall from 9.5\u202f% to roughly 7\u202f%, with similar adjustments across all country positions.\n\nThese actions reflect a shift from pure value\u2011driven country bets to a more balanced approach that still respects the 45\u202f% value component but gives greater weight to momentum, macro and judgment. The overall intent is to protect the portfolio from the heightened risk that the narrowing spread now represents while preserving the upside that still exists in cheap\u2011country exposure.",
