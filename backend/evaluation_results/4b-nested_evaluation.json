      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first looked at \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group of stocks we follow quite closely is high\u2011quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today. GMO\u2019s experience suggests that markets systematically underprice quality. In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today.\n\nOver the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004.\n\nIn the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts.\n\nFinally, as in cou",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nntry selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other).\n\nOverall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\nWhen we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s 7\u2011year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset\u2011allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nThose of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar\u2011year\u2011end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to **grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on** for what could be a difficult ride.",

We have been working on a new team structure that will allow us to better manage the portfolio and better serve our clients. We are in the final stages of this change, and we expect to complete it in the second half of 2004.\n\n**What\u2019s Next?**\nWe are currently in the process of transitioning to the new \u201cQuality-Adjusted-Value\u201d model. We are also in the process of restructuring our team to better manage the portfolio and better serve our clients. We are in the final stages of this change, and we expect to complete it in the second half of 2004.\n\nWe are also in the process of building a new investment process that will allow us to better manage the portfolio and better serve our clients.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**Implications for Portfolio Managers**\n\nEven though individual emerging markets are risky, their low correlations with each other and with developed markets enable risk reduction for modest allocations. Figure\u202f7 (Exhibit\u202f7) illustrates the risk\u2011return trade\u2011off of mixing the IFC Emerging Markets Index with the FT World Index over the five\u2011year period ending March\u202f1991. Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest. As emerging markets develop stronger financial and trade links with the rest of the world, correlations are expected to increase, eroding this free lunch.\n\nBecause of the high within\u2011market homogeneity, active managers should focus on **country selection** rather than intensive stock picking. The larger impact of country selection is evident in the higher volatility and return dispersion across countries. Nevertheless, constructing low\u2011tracking\u2011error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuab",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nle, especially given the illiquidity of many small\u2011cap stocks. Exhibit\u202f8 shows that tracking the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX in Taiwan, and the S&P\u202f500 requires roughly 75, 90, and 135 stocks respectively to achieve a 1\u202f% tracking error with two\u2011thirds confidence.\n\nFinally, the authors note that many emerging economies are projected to sustain higher real economic growth than developed economies, suggesting that medium\u2011 to long\u2011term equity returns should reflect this advantage. Coupled with diversification benefits, the case for adding emerging\u2011market exposure to a global portfolio is compelling.\n\n**Endnotes & References**\n\nThe paper cites sources such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook\u202f1991,\u201d Brown\u202f(1991), Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f(1989), and Roll\u202f(1990). The authors conclude that while emerging markets present heightened volatility, the combination of low cross\u2011market correlations, high within\u2011market homogeneity, and superior growth prospects creates a unique risk\u2011return profile for global investors.\n\n*Key take\u2011aways*\n\n* Low correlations across emerging markets \u2192 diversification benefit.\n* High within\u2011market homogeneity \u2192 country selection matters more than stock picking.\n* Modest (\u224820\u202f%) emerging\u2011market allocation can reduce portfolio risk and boost return.\n* The \u201cfree lunch\u201d may diminish as markets become more integrated.\n* Constructing index\u2011tracking baskets is feasible with relatively few stocks due to homogeneity.",
      "model_response": "...\nOkay, I need to continue the investment analysis from the given text. The user provided a detailed analysis about emerging markets, their risk-return trade-off, the concept of \"diversification free lunch,\" and the role of country selection for active managers. The text ends mid-sentence, so I need to complete the thought.\n\nFirst, I should understand the context. The previous paragraph discusses how active managers should focus on country selection rather than stock picking because of the high homogeneity within markets. The sentence is cut off at \"low-tracking-error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuable...\" So, the continuation should elaborate on the importance of constructing low-tracking-error baskets, perhaps discussing the benefits, methods, or implications of such strategies.\n\nI need to make sure the continuation is in line with the previous analysis. The key points from the previous text are:\n- Diversification benefits of emerging markets, especially with modest allocations.\n- The \"diversification free lunch\" concept.\n- Country selection is more important than stock picking.\n- Constructing low-tracking-error baskets that mimic indices is valuable.\n\nSo, the continuation should explain why constructing such baskets is valuable, maybe by discussing how they help in capturing market returns efficiently, the challenges involved, or the impact on portfolio performance. Also, the text mentions that as correlations increase, the free lunch disappears, so maybe the continuation should touch on that, or the implications of the current environment for portfolio construction.\n\nI should also check for any terms or phrases that need",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients whether the anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAt this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets, and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand.\n\nFor example, if we screen the MSCI World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50\u202f% of their sales from emerging markets, we find 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574\u202fbillion and make up only 2.1\u202f% of the market value of the MSCI World Index (see Exhibit\u202f6 for the ten largest companies in this group \u2013 not exactly the household names one expects to see).\n\nIn addition, locally\u2011domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home\u2011field advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well\u2011established local brands, government policies that tend to favour locals, and the fact that local competitors often have high profitability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share.\n\nA good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia would be extremely expensive. Moreover, they would face great difficulty competing against a well\u2011established player such as Magnit, which runs more than 4,000 stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20\u202f%. We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where it paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nHow Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework?\nLast year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top\u2011down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean\u2011reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12\u2011month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account/GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money\u2011supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value.\n\nFigure\u202f5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999\u20112013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each sub\u2011component would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12\u2011month forward returns.\n\nFigure\u202f6 shows the same m\u2011cap weighted results.\n\nOverall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand\u2011alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly fr",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nArjun Divecha\n\nOver the last 4 years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nWe have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global rivals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nAt the end of the day (as we mentioned earlier), it\u2019s not about multinationals versus locals, but which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profits that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we find that the best (but not all) opportunities are local.\n\nPerformance data supports this view. Exhibit\u202f7 shows that emerging domestic companies have outperformed developed multinationals over the past five years, while Exhibit\u202f8 demonstrates that emerging domestic stocks still trade at a modest discount to their multinational peers. The outperformance is driven by faster earnings growth rather than valuation expansion.\n\nNot all domestic opportunities are attractive. Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel).\n\nSimilarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profitability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profitability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15\u202fmillion net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profitability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. On the other hand, the financial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well\u2011established, highly profitable banks. Only about 2\u202f% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefit from this growth without having to lower their margins.\n\nThe key is to look for fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows players to have high profitability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profitability in the face of non\u2011linear demand increases are most attractive. Profitability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter.\n\n**Conclusions**\nAs a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be reflected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers.\n\nThe winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home\u2011field advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.\n\n*Disclaimer*: The views expressed are those of Arjun Divecha through the period ending 8/17/11 and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

The firm\u2019s culture is built around a belief in value investing, low turnover of investment personnel, and a 100\u202f% employee\u2011ownership structure that aligns incentives.  The Emerging Markets (EM) team is highlighted, with a roster of senior professionals\u2014including fund managers Arjun Divecha, Cliff Gong, Amit Bhartia, Sam Wilderman, and a support staff of traders, analysts and operations specialists\u2014who together oversee a quantitative research process that emphasizes country\u2011level value, controlled risk, and disciplined execution.\n\nCore to GMO\u2019s philosophy is the conviction that \u201cvalue wins in the long run\u201d and that this effect is amplified in inefficient asset classes such as emerging\u2011market equities.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients whether the anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAt this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets, and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand.\n\nFor example, if we screen the MSCI World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50\u202f% of their sales from emerging markets, we find 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574\u202fbillion and make up only 2.1\u202f% of the market value of the MSCI World Index (see Exhibit\u202f6 for the ten largest companies in this group \u2013 not exactly the household names one expects to see).\n\nIn addition, locally\u2011domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home\u2011field advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well\u2011established local brands, government policies that tend to favour locals, and the fact that local competitors often have high profitability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share.\n\nA good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia would be extremely expensive. Moreover, they would face great difficulty competing against a well\u2011established player such as Magnit, which runs more than 4,000 stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20\u202f%. We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where it paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multin",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",

      "model_response": "Okay, so I need to analyze the given text and understand the investment style it's describing. The user provided a sample analysis in the style of GMO's proprietary information, which is for institutional use only. The example given is about the \"China Syndrome\" and the first rule of EM investing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements of the sample analysis. The sample starts with a title, \"THE CHINA SYNDROME,\" which is a metaphor for a situation where a country's government is involved in a problematic situation, possibly related to economic or political issues. The first rule of EM (Emerging Markets) investing is mentioned, which suggests that the analysis is about emerging markets, particularly China, and the risks associated with government decisions.\n\nThe sample analysis seems to be warning about the risks of investing in emerging markets, especially when the government is involved in decisions that could have negative consequences. It uses a metaphor (\"China Syndrome\") to illustrate the danger of overreliance on government actions, similar to the nuclear power plant disaster where the government's role was critical and potentially catastrophic.\n\nNow, the user wants an analysis in the same style. The user's query is to provide an analysis of a topic, but the example given is a specific analysis about the China Syndrome in EM investing. So, the user is likely asking for a similar analysis, perhaps on a different topic, but following the same structure and tone.\n\nBut the user's actual query is a bit unclear.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nArjun Divecha\n\nOver the last 4 years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deli",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",

The author discusses the country selection process, the role of value in the model, and the increased risk associated with buying cheap countries.

The original text is part of a larger analysis, so the continuation should logically follow the previous points. The author is explaining that even though value is a key component of their model, they use other factors (momentum, macro, judgment) to make decisions.

In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking the tracking\u2011error down from 8\u202f% to about 6\u202f%. Consequently, our current overweight of Brazil will fall from 9.5\u202f% to roughly 7\u202f%, with similar adjustments across all country positions.\n\nThese actions reflect a shift from pure value\u2011driven country bets to a more balanced approach that still respects the 45\u202f% value component but gives greater weight to momentum, macro and judgment.

Historically value stocks trade at a 40\u202f% discount to the index; today they sit at a 34\u202f% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the fifteen\u2011year history for which we have data. The discount fell from a 46\u202f% discount in October\u202f2000 to the current 34\u202f% discount, a period during which value massively out\u2011performed.\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value behaves when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing. If value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Small\u2011cap stocks are the next logical place to look because smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness. Chart\u202f3 shows that the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32\u202f% in October\u202f2000 to just 12\u202f% today. This contraction in both value and small\u2011cap spreads occurred because both segments performed extremely well over the past four years, greatly helping our performance.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first examined \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks \u2013 companies forecast to have the highest earnings growth over the next two years. As expected, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but Chart\u202f4 shows they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group we follow closely is high\u2011quality stocks (Chart\u202f5). In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory would suggest. In emerging markets, quality stocks usually trade at a modest 9\u202f% premium to the market. Right now we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market.\n\nOver the past two years we have been developing a new measure of value that incorporates quality, and we had planned to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model with a \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. Given the current positioning of both",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nvalue and quality, we began transitioning to the new model in May\u202f2004.\n\nIn the new model we explicitly adjust a stock\u2019s attractiveness for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio will rise as quality becomes relatively cheap, while the bet on what might be called \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks will fall. It also increases the average size of companies we own \u2013 a welcome change now that small caps are no longer attractive.\n\nOverall, 70\u202f% of our stock\u2011selection process remains value\u2011driven and 30\u202f% momentum\u2011driven. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value; that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\n\nWhen we say our ability to add value is diminished, the appropriate response is not to abandon emerging markets. Valuations for the asset class suggest emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall exposure if you are overweight the asset class, but emerging equities remain among the most attractive asset classes based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s seven\u2011year forecast, and GMO is heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to move money to another emerging manager. However, the contraction of value has not created greater opportunities elsewhere, so switching styles would not be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nClients who have been with us have enjoyed the value and small\u2011cap rally. While we aim to deliver out\u2011performance of about 4\u202f% per year, the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark by 13.1\u202f% in calendar\u2011year\u2011end\u202f2003, after out\u2011performing by 4.7\u202f% in 2002 and 8.1\u202f% in 2001. If the compression of value leads to tougher times in the next couple of years, at least you have already reaped the benefits of that compression.\n\nWe are battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n**A Model to Understand Risk and Return**\n\nTo analyze risk and return, the authors develop a multi\u2011factor model similar to that used for developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f[1989]). The model hierarchically decomposes portfolio excess return (return beyond the risk\u2011free rate) into currency return, local excess return, and a cross\u2011product term. Equation\u202f(1) expresses excess numeraire return as:\n\n    Excess Numeraire Return = (Currency Return) \u2013 (Local Excess Return) + (Cross\u2011Product)\n\nwhere the currency return captures exchange\u2011rate effects and interest\u2011rate differentials, the local excess return reflects the asset\u2019s performance in its home market, and the cross\u2011product term (r_c \u00d7 r_l) is usually small and can be ignored for most markets. However, for Argentina and Brazil the cross\u2011product is material (changing annual risk by 17\u202f% and 4\u202f% respectively), so the authors model these assets directly in U.S. dollars rather than decomposing them.\n\nLocal excess return is further broken into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk\u2011index return (size, earnings\u2011to\u2011price, liquidity, etc.). Exposures to country factors are measured by betas to the market of each country; industry exposures use the Financial Times World\u2011Wide (FTWW) classification; risk\u2011index exposures are normalized within each country.\n\nThe model was estimated for assets from 23 emerging markets (February\u202f1986\u202f\u2013\u202fJuly\u202f1991) using data from the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources. The adjusted R\u00b2 for the full emerging\u2011markets model is 50\u202f%, compared with 38\u202f% for a comparable developed\u2011markets model. Two sub\u2011models help explain this difference:\n\n1. **Industry\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Industry Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 16\u202f% for emerging markets versus 22\u202f% for developed markets, indicating weaker cross\u2011country industry integration in emerging markets.\n\n2. **Country\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 46\u202f% for emerging markets versus 30\u202f% for developed markets, showing that country\u2011specific forces dominate emerging\u2011market returns.\n\n**Homogeneity within markets**\n\nThe large country\u2011factor contribution implies that stock returns within a given emerging market are more homogeneous than in developed markets. Even when stocks are equally weighted, the R\u00b2 remains high (42\u202f% vs. 29\u202f% for developed markets). The authors explore three possible explanations:\n\n* **Concentration effect** \u2013 a few large stocks dominate market capitalization.\n* **True homogeneity** \u2013 stocks move together regardless of size.\n* **Volatility\u2011driven R\u00b2** \u2013 higher market volatility inflates the explanatory power of the market factor.\n\nExhibit\u202f3 shows that most emerging markets are indeed more concentrated than developed markets, but the difference is modest. Asset\u2011concentration scores (a measure ranging from 0 for perfectly equal weights to 1 for total concentration) average around 0.13 for the larger emerging markets, compared with 0.08 for the U.S. market. Sector\u2011concentration scores are similarly modest; only a few small markets (e.g., Jordan, Nigeria) exhibit high sector concentration.\n\nWhen concentration is controlled for, the average unweighted correlation of monthly stock returns within each market remains higher for emerging markets (e.g., Taiwan 0.77, Brazil 0.70) than for developed markets (U.S. 0.49, Japan 0.46). This suggests a dominant market\u2011wide force that overwhelms industry differentials.\n\n**Heterogeneity across markets**\n\nIn contrast, emerging markets are weakly correlated with each other. Exhibit\u202f4 reports average pairwise correlations of only 0.07 over the five\u2011year sample, with many negative pairings (89 of 276 correlations are negative). The authors attribute this to limited trade links and restrictive foreign\u2011participation rules that insulated markets from one another. As globalization progresses, they expect these correlations to rise.\n\nBy comparison, developed markets exhibit an average correlation of 0.49 (Exhibit\u202f5), and the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the FT World Index is 0.35.\n\nThese findings have direct portfolio implications: low cross\u2011market correlations provide diversification benefits, while high within\u2011market homogeneity means that country selection, rather than stock picking, drives active returns in emerging markets.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nEveryone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio\u2014through increased investments in emerging markets!\\n\\nModest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk\\nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January 1988 to December 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years\u2014it is true for any five\u2011year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created).\\n\\nThis analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well\u2011diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market\u2011capitalization weights, the right answer?\\n\\nCapitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions\\nThe case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries.\\n\\nIn the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient.\\n\\nIn such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is available to global investors.\\n\\nIf market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\\n\\nIf not market or GDP weights, then what?\\nAnother proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well\u2011understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum\u2011variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight.\\n\\nThe theoretical basis for such a low\u2011volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex\u2011ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex\u2011post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex\u2011ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex\u2011post minimum\u2011variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market\u2011weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex\u2011post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean\u2011variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio.\\n\\nThus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex\u2011ante forecast of the relative return of one vis\u2011a\u2011vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles. Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\\n\\nThis weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds).",
