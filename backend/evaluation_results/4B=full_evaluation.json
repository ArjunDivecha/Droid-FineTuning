      "training_answer": "\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nArjun Divecha\n\nOver the last 4 years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",

As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the question we need to answer is: If spreads narrow, do we still have opportunities to outperform?\n\nWe examine the implications for country and stock selection within value orientation.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\n\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries (that is, they are 22% cheaper). When this spread is compressed, we would expect cheap countries to become relatively less attractive, all else being equal.\n\nWhat happened over time? As expected, the spread narrowed from 47% in May 2007 (the peak of the US/EM cycle) to 38% in December 2008 (the trough) and further to 27% by July 2011. One might expect the spread to have narrowed even more over the past 4 years, but due to the large rally in value, cheap countries have outperformed and the narrowing of spreads is partially offset by the outperformance of cheap",

Well, not all of India, but an important part of it which depends on government policy action. The reason is the exposure of corruption and scandals associated with government officials taking bribes. \nCorruption has been endemic in India since the time of independence in 1947 (and maybe well before that as well). What\u2019s different this time is that the media have been exposing this corruption and on the back of these revelations important people (more specifically senior politicians and billionaires) are being put in jail and are being kept there, with judges refusing to grant them bail. \nIn the past, these same people would give and take bribes with impunity, secure in the knowledge that they were above scrutiny and prosecution and even if they were sent to jail, could live a 5 star luxury lifestyle while there, with home cooked meals, internet access, personal butlers and afternoon tea with the wardens. In the harsh light of intense media scrutiny, all that has changed. Things have got so bad that there\u2019s anecdotal evidence that industrialists are refusing to give bribes to politicians on the grounds that the politicians are not acting despite being bribed!!! \nThis is not the fear of an innocent person being unfairly accused, but of a guilty person being afraid being exposed.

      "training_answer": "How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework?\nLast year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top\u2011down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean\u2011reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12\u2011month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account/GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money\u2011supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value.\n\nFigure\u202f5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999\u20112013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each sub\u2011component would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12\u2011month forward returns.\n\nFigure\u202f6 shows the same m\u2011cap weighted results.\n\nOverall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand\u2011alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T\u2011stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey\u2011West T\u2011stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the serial correlation.\n\nTable\u202f2 \u2013 Earnings Yield alone:\nBeta = 3.75, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 7.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 12.01.\n\nTable\u202f3 \u2013 Macro alone (normalized to one sigma):\nBeta = 10.47, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 1.1\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 6.37. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor.\n\nTable\u202f4 \u2013 Combined model:\nEarnings Yield Beta = 3.71, Macro Beta = 9.74, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 8.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stats = 11.86 (Earnings Yield) and 6.27 (Macro).\n\nThe combined regression shows that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone.\n\nConclusions:\n\u2022 D&M\u2019s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth.\n\u2022 We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past.\n\u2022 The finding that countries with poor GDP growth over the past 5\u202fyears outperform was simply an artifact of those countries being cheaper; the fallen\u2011currency effect and the future\u2011GDP effect remain strong after adjusting for value.\n\u2022 Using sliced PE performed better than dividend yield.\n\u2022 Our new macro model works on a stand\u2011alone basis and, more importantly, represents a genuine enhancement to our value\u2011based country\u2011picking process.\n\nEvelyn Huang\nArjun Divecha\n\nINTERNAL ONLY: Not for external distribution",

      "training_answer": "Dimson and Marsh Revisited\n\nWhat D&M Did:\nDimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country\u2011picking strategies for EM, from 1976\u20112013. Figure\u202f1 shows their results for equal\u2011weighted portfolios.\n\nThere are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn \u2013 first, that value works (they use Div\u202fYield as the proxy for value) to predict one\u2011year return. Second, that reversion strategies work \u2013 countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5\u202fyears. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12\u2011month local real return) don\u2019t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5\u202fyears GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1\u202fyear return.\n\nWhat We Did:\nFirst of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money.\n\nFigure\u202f2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993\u20112013. The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes.\n\nFigure\u202f3 shows the same study, but now using square\u2011root market\u2011cap to define the quintiles and market\u2011cap weighting within each quintile. Again the results don\u2019t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts).\n\nSince we think of value as being something different from Div\u202fYield, we re\u2011ran the equal\u2011weighted analysis replacing Div\u202fYield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure\u202f4 shows the results \u2013 clearly earnings yield works even better than Div\u202fYield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone.\n\nDisentangling the effects:\nLooking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value \u2013 after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap.\n\nIn order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12\u2011month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value.\n\nTable\u202f1 shows the T\u2011stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non\u2011overlapping periods).\n\n| Variable | T\u2011Stat | Adjusted R\u00b2 |\n|---|---|---|\n| DivYld | 4.57 | 4.8% |\n| Yield and Country Size | 4.71 | 1.38 |\n| Yield and Trailing 12\u202fMonth Return | 4.31 | \u20133.28 |\n| Yield and Currency Return | 4.54 | \u20132.34 |\n| Yield and Past 5\u202fYr GDP Growth | 4.47 | \u20130.96 |\n| Yield and Future 5\u202fYr GDP Growth | 5.06 | 3.78 |\n\nThe one clear conclusion is that Past 5\u202fYr GDP growth is a proxy for value \u2013 adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T\u2011stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don\u2019t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return.",

It is telling that the only dissenting voice to speak up is that of his own maverick economic advisor Andrei Illarionov who said, \u201cThe sale of Yuganskneftegaz to a mystical, and now not so mystical, company named Baikal Finance Group has won this year\u2019s \u2018shady deal\u2019 of the year award.\u201d While Mr. Putin has ignored the free\u2011speaking Illarionov\u2019s inflammatory comments in the past, it will be interesting to see how he will react to this outburst.\n\nIf Mr. Putin succeeds in creating this new paradigm of government\u2011sponsored capitalism (and I believe that in the short run, he very well might), my fear is that he will create a new model for development that will be detrimental to minority shareholders such as ourselves, not just in Russia, but elsewhere as well.\n\nSo will he succeed? With high oil prices, a reduced foreign debt load, and massive foreign exchange reserves, there are no dark clouds on the horizon.

With communism and socialism having been so thoroughly and comprehensively discredited, there was only one competing paradigm for economic development \u2013 that of free and open markets and privatization of government owned companies, rather than nationalization and central planning. It was based on this shift that I made my long\u2011term case for investing in emerging markets (although from a short\u2011term point of view, October 1993 did not represent particularly good timing on my part).\n\nI also said that I did not believe that this golden age would last forever, that former socialists/authoritarians had not suddenly turned into committed free\u2011traders, but were biding their time and would surely make a re\u2011appearance some day, selling the same old vodka in new bottles.\n\nThat day may now have arrived in Russia.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Putin is trying to create a model of the modern authoritarian state where private corporations and government owned/controlled entities both serve some greater \u201cnational good\u201d in addition to attempting to enrich their shareholders.\n\nThe Yukos case serves as a multi\u2011pronged attempt in attaining this goal. On one hand, it is perhaps the first step in reversing some of the privatizations of the early 90s and to establish a \u201cnational energy company\u201d \u2013 a government controlled energy giant that would play in the same league as OPEC. While economic reasons play a role, the primary motivation is to serve Russia\u2019s geopolitical goals.

(GMO), a privately\u2011held investment firm founded in 1977 that manages roughly $22\u202fbillion in assets, split among international equities, U.S. equities and global fixed income.  The firm\u2019s culture is built around a belief in value investing, low turnover of investment personnel, and a 100\u202f% employee\u2011ownership structure that aligns incentives.  The Emerging Markets (EM) team is highlighted, with a roster of senior professionals\u2014including fund managers Arjun Divecha, Cliff Gong, Amit Bhartia, Sam Wilderman, and a support staff of traders, analysts and operations specialists\u2014who together oversee a quantitative research process that emphasizes country\u2011level value, controlled risk, and disciplined execution.\n\nCore to GMO\u2019s philosophy is the conviction that \u201cvalue wins in the long run\u201d and that this effect is amplified in inefficient asset classes such as emerging\u2011market equities.  The firm seeks to outperform the IFC Investable Emerging Markets Index by roughly 4\u202f% per year, net of fees, by applying a quantitative framework that processes large data sets quickly, removes emotional bias, and validates ideas through extensive back\u2011testing.  The quantitative approach is broken into four pillars: Value Orientation, Controlled Risk, Country Emphasis, and Employee Ownership.  The presentation uses analogies such as \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself\u2026but it rhymes\u201d and the military\u2011style warning \u201cDon\u2019t fire until you see the whites of their eyes\u201d to illustrate the importance of timing and disciplined exposure.\n\nRisk control is portrayed as a critical differentiator.  GMO\u2019s proprietary risk model separates intended exposures from incidental bets, allowing the portfolio to accentuate high\u2011conviction country and stock positions while dampening unintended factor risks.  The model is described as a quadratic optimizer that maximizes a utility function defined as Alpha \u2013 Risk \u2013 Transaction Costs.  The firm argues that in emerging markets, country selection dominates sector selection because of lower economic integration, higher endogenous risk, and the outsized influence of local investors.\n\nThe slide deck also outlines the stock\u2011selection methodology: a blend of a proprietary value model (70\u202f% weight) and momentum signals (30\u202f% weight).  Historical back\u2011tests show the value component delivering an average return of 5.6\u202f% with 4.3\u202f% volatility, while momentum adds 4.8\u202f% return with 4.4\u202f% volatility; the combined strategy yields 5.4\u202f% return at 3.2\u202f% volatility.  The team emphasizes that the process is parsimonious\u2014models are kept simple, thoughtful and justifiable\u2014yet robust, employing multiple sub\u2011models within each discipline to enhance consistency.\n\nOverall, the first half of the deck conveys a narrative that blends quantitative rigor with a clear, personal voice (\u201cWe believe that value wins in the long run,\u201d \u201cWe have exceeded our performance objectives\u201d), supported by data points, analogies, and memorable slogans that reinforce the firm\u2019s competitive advantages.",

As a result, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks have narrowed. Because we are primarily value investors, that narrowing would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\n\nChart\u202f1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive ones. In normal times cheap countries trade at 78\u202f% of the valuation of expensive countries \u2013 a 22\u202f% discount. Right now that discount has narrowed to 15\u202f%. Does that mean cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount two years ago and value worked very well for country selection since then. By contrast, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (the latter half of the Asian crisis) cheap countries suffered their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next twelve months.\n\nWhat this means, in our view, is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About",

Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form the remaining 55\u202f% and we have no evidence that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. Our work on currency vulnerability also shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking\u2011error of around 8\u202f%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking the tracking\u2011error down from 8\u202f% to about 6\u202f%. Consequently, our current overweight of Brazil will fall from 9.5\u202f% to roughly 7\u202f%, with similar adjustments across all country positions.\n\nThese actions reflect a shift from pure value\u2011driven country bets to a more balanced approach that still respects the 45\u202f% value component but gives greater weight to momentum, macro and judgment. The overall intent is to protect the portfolio from the heightened risk that the narrowing spread now represents while preserving the upside that still exists in cheap\u2011country exposure.",

And right now, like in 1998, everybody with half a brain can see that these new technologies are going to be huge. But, unfortunately, there are very few ways to play that glorious future that\u2019s in the near future.\n\nWe all know the story of Levi Strauss & Co. during the California Gold Rush \u2013 the equipment suppliers that made money in that bubble.\n\nAnd so we see Cisco and Nvidia today in a similar vein. \n\nBut once the technology starts to be used to actually change the world, other companies are major beneficiaries (like Amazon, Google etc.) and the equipment suppliers are correctly seen as commodity producers with low margins as competition seeps in.\n\nAnd so it is today. Here\u2019s a chart of Cisco vs Nvidia starting 18 months before the top of the tech bubble on a similar time and return scale.\n\nAre we now at the top for Nvidia? That\u2019s unknowable.\n\nAs my colleague Jeremey Grantham likes to say, trying to figure out the top of a bubble is like charting the path of a feather in a hurricane. You have no idea as to how far or how high it will go. There is only one thing you know with certainty. It will hit the ground.\n\nAnd so it was with Cisco\u2026 \n\nIf you bought it at the top - almost 25 years later, you\u2019re still losing money.\n\n\n\nSo will Nvidia follow suit? Inevitably.\n\nWhat I predict is that sometime in the next 12 months, we will see the peak. And you\u2019re a fool if you think you can time that event exactly.\n\nMy advice is to sell 1/12th of your Nvidia holding now and another 1/12th every month for the next 12 months irrespective of what the stock does. That way, if I\u2019m right that the top will be in the next 12 months, you will have got out near the top. And save yourself a bunch of sleepless nights.",

In that case, the rich rewards go to the people who got it right early enough to build moats around their cheap equipment and then double (or triple, quadruple) down on capital expenditures. The established companies with long relationships with their customers, high brand awareness and high barriers to entry will benefit from the resulting infrastructure boom. \n\nSo who\u2019s going to be the winner/loser in this new technology story? \n\nIt\u2019s interesting that Cisco chose to partner with Google instead of Apple or Microsoft to build their network around.

Slide\u202f17 lists Vietnam\u2019s strengths: strong economic growth, a young and productive labor force, a government that has signed many FTAs, heavy infrastructure investment, low inflation, a stable political environment, a strategic Southeast\u2011Asian location, and cultural proximity to China. Slide\u202f18 reinforces Vietnam\u2019s similarity to China\u2019s export profile.\n\nSlide\u202f19 provides a side\u2011by\u2011side chart (source: Gabriel Cortes/CNBC, MDS Transmodal) showing that China\u2019s share of global consumer\u2011goods exports has been falling since 2016, while Vietnam\u2019s share has risen over the same period, highlighting a concrete shift in market share.\n\nSlides\u202f20\u201127 shift to Mexico as a near\u2011shoring hub. Slide\u202f20 outlines macro\u2011economic stability, an independent central bank, high real rates, growing remittances (4\u202f% of GDP in 2022), and double\u2011digit FDI inflows ($35\u202fbn). Near\u2011shoring is projected to boost Mexican GDP by 50\u2011100\u202fbps per annum. Slides\u202f21\u201122 present data on Mexico\u2019s steady debt\u2011to\u2011GDP ratio and a chart of remittance inflows (USD\u202f70\u202fbn in 2022). Slides\u202f23\u201127 detail Mexico\u2019s competitive advantages: a 3,000\u202fkm border with the United States, a rule\u2011based trade framework (USMCA plus 13 other FTAs), mature manufacturing ecosystems, lower labor costs, and rising shares in total U.S. trade and U.S. manufacturing trade, with Mexico overtaking China as the top partner in 2023.\n\nSlide\u202f28 poses the question \u201cWhere are the best opportunities?\u201d and hints at a model that maps country\u2011sector exposures.\n\nSlides\u202f29\u201130 outline the \u201cBeyond China\u201d portfolio construction logic, using criteria such as market\u2011share gain, industrial\u2011park demand, global capex trends, and near\u2011shoring\u2011driven growth. The slides use check\u2011marks to indicate which criteria each potential holding satisfies.\n\nSlides\u202f31\u201134 provide concrete equity examples. Slide\u202f31 discusses Vesta (Mexico real\u2011estate) \u2013 a minority\u2011shareholder\u2011friendly, low\u2011cost\u2011land\u2011bank, ESG\u2011focused company positioned to benefit from near\u2011shoring and e\u2011commerce. Slide\u202f32 examines Kinh\u202fBac City (Vietnam industrial parks), highlighting its large land bank, proximity to China, and tenant base (Canon, Foxconn, LG). Slide\u202f33 profiles WEG (Brazil capital\u2011goods maker) as a beneficiary of the \u201cMOC\u201d (manufacturing\u2011outside\u2011China) theme, citing its 18.5\u202f% CAGR, global footprint, and leadership in low\u2011voltage motors. Slide\u202f34 looks at Delta Electronics Thailand, emphasizing its role in EV\u2011related power supplies, the Eastern Economic Corridor, and exposure to Chinese auto\u2011maker diversification.\n\nThis chunk is data\u2011heavy (charts, percentages, growth rates) and largely descriptive, with minimal personal narrative and no explicit analogies.",
      "model_response": "...Continued\n\nSlide\u202f20 provides a similar list for Mexico, highlighting its large consumer market, proximity to the U.S., a mature and diversified economy, and a stable, pro\u2011U.S. government. \n\nSlide\u202f21 outlines the criteria for selecting alternative countries: low correlation to China/Taiwan, high correlation within the asset class, high economic and demographic growth, strong government policy orientation, and exposure to the unfulfilled demand from China/Taiwan. \n\nSlide\u202f22 presents a table of growth and demographics for the most attractive alternative countries, showing higher GDP growth and labor force expansion compared to China/Taiwan. \n\nSlide\u202f23 asks how far away these alternative countries are from China\u2019s peers, using a simple distance metric (kilometers) to show that Vietnam and Mexico are relatively close to China ports, whereas Thailand and Indonesia are farther away. \n\nSlide\u202f24 concludes the presentation with a summary chart that maps China\u2019s industrial categories onto potential alternative locations, reinforcing the case for Vietnam, Mexico, Thailand, and India to serve as near\u2011shoring/liquidation hubs. \n\nThis chunk is rich in data visualisations (charts, tables) and analogies (e.g., \u201cfrom oil to bananas\u201d) but contains very few personal narratives or emotional appeals.

As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deli",
      "training_answer": "ver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",

      "training_answer": "Recently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients whether the anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAt this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets, and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand.\n\nFor example, if we screen the MSCI World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50\u202f% of their sales from emerging markets, we find 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574\u202fbillion and make up only 2.1\u202f% of the market value of the MSCI World Index (see Exhibit\u202f6 for the ten largest companies in this group \u2013 not exactly the household names one expects to see).\n\nIn addition, locally\u2011domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home\u2011field advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well\u2011established local brands, government policies that tend to favour locals, and the fact that local competitors often have high profitability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share.\n\nA good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia would be extremely expensive. Moreover, they would face great difficulty competing against a well\u2011established player such as Magnit, which runs more than 4,000 stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20\u202f%. We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where it paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",

In the long term, our view is that this is not a simple question of one versus the other, but of which sectors and countries are positioned to benefit from these changes in demand, and how their competitive positions translate into strong profitability and a capacity to grow.\n\nAt this point in time, however, there are clear opportunities where domestic companies are best positioned to take advantage of the large near\u2011shoring/home\u2011field effect.\n\nNear\u2011shoring/home\u2011field effect \u2013 what it is and why it is so powerful\nNear\u2011shoring refers to companies moving their supply chains and operations closer to their target markets, usually within the same continent or region. The home\u2011field effect is the phenomenon that teams/companies located in a country tend to have an edge competing against rivals based outside that country because of factors such as lower costs, better cultural fit, government support, and established networks.\n\nThe home\u2011field effect has been well documented in both emerging and developed markets. A study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) of companies listed on the IFC Global Index of the largest companies by market capitalization in emerging markets (as of December 2018) found that domestic companies outperformed foreign companies in emerging markets over the past five years, with a spread",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\n\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, Chart\u202f2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time relative to the index. Historically value stocks trade at a 40\u202f% discount to the index; today they sit at a 34\u202f% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the fifteen\u2011year history for which we have data. The discount fell from a 46\u202f% discount in October\u202f2000 to the current 34\u202f% discount, a period during which value massively out\u2011performed.\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value behaves when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing. If value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Small\u2011cap stocks are the next logical place to look because smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness. Chart\u202f3 shows that the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32\u202f% in October\u202f2000 to just 12\u202f% today. This contraction in both value and small\u2011cap spreads occurred because both segments performed extremely well over the past four years, greatly helping our performance.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first examined \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks \u2013 companies forecast to have the highest earnings growth over the next two years. As expected, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but Chart\u202f4 shows they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group we follow closely is high\u2011quality stocks (Chart\u202f5). In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory would suggest. In emerging markets, quality stocks usually trade at a modest 9\u202f% premium to the market. Right now we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market.\n\nOver the past two years we have been developing a new measure of value that incorporates quality, and we had planned to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model with a \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. Given the current positioning of both",
      "training_answer": "value and quality, we began transitioning to the new model in May\u202f2004.\n\nIn the new model we explicitly adjust a stock\u2019s attractiveness for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio will rise as quality becomes relatively cheap, while the bet on what might be called \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks will fall. It also increases the average size of companies we own \u2013 a welcome change now that small caps are no longer attractive.\n\nOverall, 70\u202f% of our stock\u2011selection process remains value\u2011driven and 30\u202f% momentum\u2011driven. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value; that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\n\nWhen we say our ability to add value is diminished, the appropriate response is not to abandon emerging markets. Valuations for the asset class suggest emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall exposure if you are overweight the asset class, but emerging equities remain among the most attractive asset classes based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s seven\u2011year forecast, and GMO is heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to move money to another emerging manager. However, the contraction of value has not created greater opportunities elsewhere, so switching styles would not be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nClients who have been with us have enjoyed the value and small\u2011cap rally. While we aim to deliver out\u2011performance of about 4\u202f% per year, the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark by 13.1\u202f% in calendar\u2011year\u2011end\u202f2003, after out\u2011performing by 4.7\u202f% in 2002 and 8.1\u202f% in 2001. If the compression of value leads to tougher times in the next couple of years, at least you have already reaped the benefits of that compression.\n\nWe are battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride.",
      "model_response": "metrics, this seems like an opportune time to make the switch. After extensive back\u2011testing, we are confident the new model will enhance our ability to deliver risk\u2011adjusted value addition.\n\nWe also review our stock\u2011selection process to make sure it is not overly dependent on fallen\u2011celebrity stocks (such as Cisco or Dell) to perform well. Modest changes in their valuations would have had a limited impact on our portfolio weighting, and we have a substantial allocation to financial and consumer stocks that were not as heavily impacted by the technology bubble as were fallen\u2011celebrity stocks.\n\nFinally, we review the attractiveness of sectors that might benefit from the current positioning of value and small caps. The construction and real\u2011estate sectors appear particularly attractive to us, based on their cyclicality, high profitability, and well\u2011established franchises.\n\nIn short, while the positioning of value and small caps has deteriorated, other segments of the market still present attractive opportunities for us. We are already working on changes to our investment process to take advantage of these developments and to further enhance our ability to deliver risk\u2011managed, value\u2011adding investments.\n\n**Gratitude**\n\nThis monthly commentary is authored by Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co.

      "training_answer": "Ruminations on China and India\nArjun Divecha\n\nChina: If you build it, they will come\u2026\nIndia: You\u2019re not going to build it, but they\u2019ll come anyway\u2026\n\nIt occurred to me that this is a good metaphor for China and India and the resulting implications for growth and investment return.\n\nLast month I had a long chat with one of the people in China whose views I most respect. He is extremely plugged in with the financial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefit. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions.\n\nIn my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and financial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long\u2011term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital?\n\nOne of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by Edward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high\u2011speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure financial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high\u2011speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high\u2011speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high\u2011speed rail in expansive continental geographies.\n\nIn short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have difficult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years).\n\nThe one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government actually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song). As you may guess, none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profits by investing in telecoms outside of India. This is what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high profits because producers benefitted from shortages.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of bad policy\u2011making (India consistently runs high budget deficits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high\u2011return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefits investors by delivering high return on investment.\n\nNow this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India benefits from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high\u2011cost\u2011of\u2011capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth.\n\nI believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to grow. We already see inflation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High inflation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high\u2011inflation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs.\n\nNevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom\u2011up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state\u2011directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profit\u2011maximizers.\n\nIn the final analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profitability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t focus on growth. Focus on profitability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation \u2013 we are willing to pay a premium for profitability, but not to overpay for it.\n\nCurrent positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring inflation down, a task that is made much harder by the proliferate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of Arjun Divecha and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nWe have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global ri",
      "training_answer": "vals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",

Given that the U.S. and China are both large producers and consumers of energy and minerals, it seems as though we are in the middle of a supply\u2011demand equilibrium that will likely ease with growing Chinese economic strength. In any case, it is hard to see how commodity producers in Brazil, for example, will do well if the Chinese economy slows down or moves away from heavy industry.\n\nIn contrast, the case for companies that serve domestic demand is less dependent on what happens in the developed world. After all, if the Chinese economy slows down, demand for Chinese exports will fall, but Chinese consumers will still be around (assuming they become wealthy) and will cut down their consumption of cigarettes, automobiles, and consumer electronics. In the near future, the main reason for failure in emerging markets will likely be oversupply and competitive intensification, rather than economic contraction. Thus, winners within domestic demand will largely be those that can secure a large market share in the face of intense competition, as opposed to companies that rely on market\u2011share gains from other segments.\n\nIn the exporter space, we tend to look for companies with moats that can be translated into market\u2011share advantages. For example, a cost\u2011advantage in a competitive market is only valuable if that cost is reflected in prices, which",
