      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nOver the last four years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets \u2013 both cheap countries and cheap stocks. As a result, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks have narrowed. Because we are primarily value investors, that narrowing would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\n\nChart\u202f1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive ones. In normal times cheap countries trade at 78\u202f% of the valuation of expensive countries \u2013 a 22\u202f% discount. Right now that discount has narrowed to 15\u202f%. Does that mean cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount two years ago and value worked very well for country selection since then. By contrast, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (the latter half of the Asian crisis) cheap countries suffered their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next twelve months.\n\nWhat this means, in our view, is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (45\u202f% weight in our country\u2011assessment model), it is not the only metric we use. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form the remaining 55\u202f% and we have no evidence that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. Our work on currency vulnerability also shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking\u2011error of around 8\u202f%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking the tracking\u2011error down from 8\u202f% to about 6\u202f%. Consequently, our current overweight of Brazil will fall from 9.5\u202f% to roughly 7\u202f%, with similar adjustments across all country positions.\n\nThese actions reflect a shift from pure value\u2011driven country bets to a more balanced approach that still respects the 45\u202f% value component but gives greater weight to momentum, macro and judgment. The overall intent is to protect the portfolio from the heightened risk that the narrowing spread now represents while preserving the upside that still exists in cheap\u2011country exposure.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nEveryone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio\u2014through increased investments in emerging markets!\\n\\nModest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk\\nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January 1988 to December 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years\u2014it is true for any five\u2011year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created).\\n\\nThis analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well\u2011diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market\u2011capitalization weights, the right answer?\\n\\nCapitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions\\nThe case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries.\\n\\nIn the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient.\\n\\nIn such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is available to global investors.\\n\\nIf market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\\n\\nIf not market or GDP weights, then what?\\nAnother proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well\u2011understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum\u2011variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight.\\n\\nThe theoretical basis for such a low\u2011volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex\u2011ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex\u2011post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex\u2011ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex\u2011post minimum\u2011variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market\u2011weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex\u2011post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean\u2011variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio.\\n\\nThus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex\u2011ante forecast of the relative return of one vis\u2011a\u2011vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles. Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\\n\\nThis weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds).",
      "model_response": "[continuation]  the authors show that investment in a well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio of between 60 and 80 countries would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio. They call this effect \"diversification discount\" and show that investors should explicitly take it into account when deciding how much to put in emerging markets. They also show that the discount is larger for countries with lower local market capitalization and that active managers tend to do a better job of adding value in emerging markets than value\u2011adding managers in developed markets. \n\nWhat's the author's point in this analysis? To show that emerging markets can be part of a global investment strategy, and that putting a large chunk of your portfolio in them is not necessarily as risky as one might think, provided one diversifies appropriately. \n\nWho would find this analysis particularly interesting? Emerging markets specialists, global portfolio managers, investors with a medium to high risk capacity who are willing to take on the extra risk of emerging markets, and anyone who believes in the \"greater magic\" of emerging markets (as opposed to developed markets) where active managers can deliver outperformance. \n\nWhat's the investment message here? That emerging markets can be as (if not more) magical than developed markets, but that the key is to invest in a well\u2011diversified manner and to recognize the diversification benefit. The authors also mention that active managers have an edge in emerging markets, but provide no data to back this",

The narrative stresses that the U.S.\u2013China \u201cEconomic War\u201d is a long\u2011run battle over technology, military power, and ideology, and that the combined weight of Taiwan and China represents roughly half of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, creating a negative net effect for that asset class.

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first looked at \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group of stocks we follow quite closely is high\u2011quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today. GMO\u2019s experience suggests that markets systematically underprice quality. In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today.\n\nOver the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004.\n\nIn the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts.\n\nFinally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other).\n\nOverall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\nWhen we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s 7\u2011year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset\u2011allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nThose of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar\u2011year\u2011end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to **grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on** for what could be a difficult ride.",
      "model_response": "something related to value \u2013 high\u2011quality stocks \u2013 to see if that in some way mitigates the value risk. However, the data does not show any mitigating effect; quality and value are uncorrelated at this point in time.\n\nWe then examined stocks that have been poorly positioned over the past three months (defined as low momentum and P/E ratios) to see if there are opportunities to buy them at reasonable risk\u2011adjusted spreads. After all, if value is not well positioned, one would expect these stocks to be the most attractive buying opportunities. The analysis shows that there are a number of stocks with substantial risk\u2011adjusted spreads to their respective indices and that these spreads are indeed narrowing. While not attractive at the outset, the situation is clearly improving and presents a good opportunity to start building a position.\n\nIn addition, we reviewed other investment strategies to see if they are well positioned to deliver outperformance right now. The results show that our current real\u2011estate and global\u2011value strategies are well positioned to deliver alpha in the current environment, while our U.S. value strategy is not. This is partly due to the real\u2011estate strategy\u2019s focus on high\u2011quality, low\u2011debt, high\u2011discount real\u2011estate companies and its time\u2011series record of outperformance, which is best manifested in periods of market stress such as the recent U.S. housing crisis.\n\nWe also re\u2011examine our stock\u2011picking process to see if there are any near\u2011term changes that",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n**Implications for Portfolio Managers**\n\nEven though individual emerging markets are risky, their low correlations with each other and with developed markets enable risk reduction for modest allocations. Figure\u202f7 (Exhibit\u202f7) illustrates the risk\u2011return trade\u2011off of mixing the IFC Emerging Markets Index with the FT World Index over the five\u2011year period ending March\u202f1991. Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest. As emerging markets develop stronger financial and trade links with the rest of the world, correlations are expected to increase, eroding this free lunch.\n\nBecause of the high within\u2011market homogeneity, active managers should focus on **country selection** rather than intensive stock picking. The larger impact of country selection is evident in the higher volatility and return dispersion across countries. Nevertheless, constructing low\u2011tracking\u2011error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuable, especially given the illiquidity of many small\u2011cap stocks. Exhibit\u202f8 shows that tracking the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX in Taiwan, and the S&P\u202f500 requires roughly 75, 90, and 135 stocks respectively to achieve a 1\u202f% tracking error with two\u2011thirds confidence.\n\nFinally, the authors note that many emerging economies are projected to sustain higher real economic growth than developed economies, suggesting that medium\u2011 to long\u2011term equity returns should reflect this advantage. Coupled with diversification benefits, the case for adding emerging\u2011market exposure to a global portfolio is compelling.\n\n**Endnotes & References**\n\nThe paper cites sources such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook\u202f1991,\u201d Brown\u202f(1991), Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f(1989), and Roll\u202f(1990).

The finding that emerging markets have outperformed developed markets over the past five years suggests that active managers should consider adding emerging\u2010market exposure to their current portfolio.\n\nThe authors back up their risk\u2010framework with detailed historical data and multiple risk\u2010modeling exercises. They show that the combined market cap of the EM indices exceeds that of the MSCI World Index, that asset allocations of 20% to 30% emerging\u2010market exposure would reduce overall portfolio volatility, and that the probability of a drawdown to the crisis level is cut in half for a 20% allocation and nearly eliminated for a 30% allocation.\n\nTo further illustrate the risk\u2010benefit trade\u2010off, they present a series of illustrative portfolio scenarios: a 20% emerging\u2010market allocation with a 25% bet on Russia (as a proxy for energy) would reduce risk by 14% and cut the probability of a severe drawdown from 35% to 14%; a 30% emerging\u2010market bet with a 50% Russia bet would cut risk by 22% and the drawdown probability from 35% to just 6%.\n\nThe document concludes that the current environment (low correlations, superior performance,",

As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",

In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries (that is, they are 22% cheaper). When this spread is compressed, we would expect cheap countries to become relatively less attractive, all else being equal.\n\nWhat happened over time? As expected, the spread narrowed from 47% in May 2007 (the peak of the US/EM cycle) to 38% in December 2008 (the trough) and further to 27% by July 2011. One might expect the spread to have narrowed even more over the past 4 years, but due to the large rally in value, cheap countries have outperformed and the narrowing of spreads is partially offset by the outperformance of cheap",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**A Model to Understand Risk and Return**\n\nTo analyze risk and return, the authors develop a multi\u2011factor model similar to that used for developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f[1989]). The model hierarchically decomposes portfolio excess return (return beyond the risk\u2011free rate) into currency return, local excess return, and a cross\u2011product term. Equation\u202f(1) expresses excess numeraire return as:\n\n    Excess Numeraire Return = (Currency Return) \u2013 (Local Excess Return) + (Cross\u2011Product)\n\nwhere the currency return captures exchange\u2011rate effects and interest\u2011rate differentials, the local excess return reflects the asset\u2019s performance in its home market, and the cross\u2011product term (r_c \u00d7 r_l) is usually small and can be ignored for most markets. However, for Argentina and Brazil the cross\u2011product is material (changing annual risk by 17\u202f% and 4\u202f% respectively), so the authors model these assets directly in U.S. dollars rather than decomposing them.\n\nLocal excess return is further broken into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk\u2011index return (size, earnings\u2011to\u2011price, liquidity, etc.). Exposures to country factors are measured by betas to the market of each country; industry exposures use the Financial Times World\u2011Wide (FTWW) classification; risk\u2011index exposures are normalized within each country.\n\nThe model was estimated for assets from 23 emerging markets (February\u202f1986\u202f\u2013\u202fJuly\u202f1991) using data from the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources. The adjusted R\u00b2 for the full emerging\u2011markets model is 50\u202f%, compared with 38\u202f% for a comparable developed\u2011markets model. Two sub\u2011models help explain this difference:\n\n1. **Industry\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Industry Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 16\u202f% for emerging markets versus 22\u202f% for developed markets, indicating weaker cross\u2011country industry integration in emerging markets.\n\n2. **Country\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 46\u202f% for emerging markets versus 30\u202f% for developed markets, showing that country\u2011specific forces dominate emerging\u2011market returns.\n\n**Homogeneity within markets**\n\nThe large cou",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nntry\u2011factor contribution implies that stock returns within a given emerging market are more homogeneous than in developed markets. Even when stocks are equally weighted, the R\u00b2 remains high (42\u202f% vs. 29\u202f% for developed markets). The authors explore three possible explanations:\n\n* **Concentration effect** \u2013 a few large stocks dominate market capitalization.\n* **True homogeneity** \u2013 stocks move together regardless of size.\n* **Volatility\u2011driven R\u00b2** \u2013 higher market volatility inflates the explanatory power of the market factor.\n\nExhibit\u202f3 shows that most emerging markets are indeed more concentrated than developed markets, but the difference is modest. Asset\u2011concentration scores (a measure ranging from 0 for perfectly equal weights to 1 for total concentration) average around 0.13 for the larger emerging markets, compared with 0.08 for the U.S. market. Sector\u2011concentration scores are similarly modest; only a few small markets (e.g., Jordan, Nigeria) exhibit high sector concentration.\n\nWhen concentration is controlled for, the average unweighted correlation of monthly stock returns within each market remains higher for emerging markets (e.g., Taiwan 0.77, Brazil 0.70) than for developed markets (U.S. 0.49, Japan 0.46). This suggests a dominant market\u2011wide force that overwhelms industry differentials.\n\n**Heterogeneity across markets**\n\nIn contrast, emerging markets are weakly correlated with each other. Exhibit\u202f4 reports average pairwise correlations of only 0.07 over the five\u2011year sample, with many negative pairings (89 of 276 correlations are negative). The authors attribute this to limited trade links and restrictive foreign\u2011participation rules that insulated markets from one another. As globalization progresses, they expect these correlations to rise.\n\nBy comparison, developed markets exhibit an average correlation of 0.49 (Exhibit\u202f5), and the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the FT World Index is 0.35.\n\nThese findings have direct portfolio implications: low cross\u2011market correlations provide diversification benefits, while high within\u2011market homogeneity means that country selection, rather than stock picking, drives active returns in emerging markets.",
      "model_response": "The large country\u2011only R\u00b2 suggests that emerging markets are more homogeneous within each market than developed markets. Two illustrations are provided:\n\n- **Energy sector, Brazil vs. Korea**: Betas for Korea Energy = 1.57, Brazil Energy = 0.75; volatility of Energy = 23\u202f% vs. 17\u202f%; correlation within Energy = 0.48 vs. 0.81. The lower homogeneity in Brazil reflects its oil\u2011dependent economy.\n\n- **Consumer sector, Taiwan vs. Korea**: Betas are very similar (0.83 vs. 0.93), volatilities are close (14\u202f% vs. 16\u202f%), and correlation within Consumer is high (0.76 vs. 0.80), highlighting Korea\u2019s greater market homogeneity.\n\n**Heterogeneity across markets**\n\nConversely, the authors find that emerging markets are less homogeneous across markets than developed markets. Examples include:\n\n- **Latin America vs. Asia**: Correlation of country returns = 0.35 vs. 0.68.\n- **Consumer vs. Financial sector correlations**: Country correlation for Consumer is 0.33 vs. 0.64 for Financial.\n\nThese findings imply that active managers who \u201cthink like value investors\u201d (focus on individual company attractiveness) are likely to do better in emerging markets, while those who mimic market beta",

What\u2019s different this time is that the media have been exposing this corruption and on the back of these revelations important people (more specifically senior politicians and billionaires) are being put in jail and are being kept there, with judges refusing to grant them bail. \nIn the past, these same people would give and take bribes with impunity, secure in the knowledge that they were above scrutiny and prosecution and even if they were sent to jail, could live a 5 star luxury lifestyle while there, with home cooked meals, internet access, personal butlers and afternoon tea with the wardens.

And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that\u2019s why we got it wrong.\n\nWe manage EMF with a focus on the top down \u2013 our view is (and has been for the entire 28\u2011year period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60\u201170% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors.\n\nWe do this in a primarily quantitative fashion \u2013 using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions \u2013 value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance.\n\nThis strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and it remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies.\n\nWith that as background, let\u2019s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis.\n\nRussia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation.\n\nSo then the question became \u2013 in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether?\n\nAlas, we did not.\n\nWhat was our thinking behind this?\n\nWe believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all\u2011out assault on the entire country, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, a 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes.\n\nBut even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about\u2011face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well.\n\nThe issues in our minds are \u2013 what could/should we have done differently?\n\nFirst of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black\u2011swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex\u2011ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Let\u2019s assume that I\u2019m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be devoted to protecting against black\u2011swan events, i.e., how much tail\u2011risk insurance should you buy?\n\nThe answer I come to is the same I did prior to this \u2013 very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions.\n\nThe next question is did we right\u2011size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide \u2013 our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not led to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8\u20119%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin\u2019s eyes\u2026\n\nChina / Taiwan beckons\u2026",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nThe second half of the deck maps out who stands to benefit from the China exodus and how investors can capture the opportunity. A matrix of impact factors (export structure, domestic market size, institutional capacity, labor & demographics, and relocating companies) highlights a diverse set of countries \u2013 Kuwait, Qatar, Chile, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam \u2013 as potential winners. Detailed data on Taiwan\u2019s outward investment shows a clear shift from mainland China to ASEAN. India\u2019s capital\u2011expenditure trends and sector\u2011wise infrastructure spending (energy, metals, power, automotive, telecom, cement, financial services) illustrate a growing capacity to absorb displaced manufacturing. Demographic projections for Mexico show a favorable dependency ratio, rising secondary\u2011education attainment, and expanding domestic credit, positioning it as a strong near\u2011shoring hub. The presentation then lists thematic investment ideas that benefit from near\u2011shoring: higher economic growth banks, retail, market\u2011share gains from Chinese competitors, tech hardware, apparel, chemicals, consumer electronics, EV batteries, construction materials, engineering, auto components, real\u2011estate and infrastructure, ports, logistics, energy, industrial machinery, high\u2011end semiconductor equipment, and air\u2011conditioning. Country\u2011sector exposure tables map these themes onto specific markets (Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam, etc.). The \u201cBeyond China\u201d investment strategy is distilled into five steps: pick the right countries, pick the right sectors, select high\u2011quality companies, control risk, and build diversified, non\u2011benchmark\u2011sensitive portfolios. Valuation charts show that the \u201cBeyond China\u201d universe is not expensive \u2013 P/E and price\u2011to\u2011book multiples are flat relative to MSCI Emerging Markets. A concrete example is provided with Mexico\u2019s Vesta real\u2011estate platform, showing property locations, price trends and price\u2011to\u2011net\u2011asset\u2011value growth, underscoring the real\u2011estate upside in a near\u2011shoring environment. The deck concludes with forward\u2011looking statements: Indian companies have doubled sales in four years, Apple plans 25\u202f% of iPhone production in India by 2025, and the Indian semiconductor market could reach $63\u202fbn by 2026. The author emphasizes that the \u201cBeyond China\u201d journey is in its early stages, with only 10\u202f% of China\u2019s industry export scale currently mirrored by peers, and that the opportunity is still unfolding. The final slides contain standard disclaimer language and a reminder that the presented performance is simulated and not guaranteed.",

A matrix of impact factors (export structure, domestic market size, institutional capacity, labor & demographics, and relocating companies) is used to identify which countries are most likely to benefit from a given export sector moving out of China. Detailed country analyses (Mexico, Vietnam, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia) are provided, with pro forma financial data showing increased industrial output, expanded electricity demand, and projected GDP growth. The presentation also includes a series of analogies to historical migration patterns (e.g., European migration to the US in the 19th century, Japanese investment in Thailand during the 1980s) to draw parallels and reinforce the narrative. Data tables and financial projections (e.g., USD 12\u202fbn industrial output in Mexico by 2025, India\u2019s automotive market doubling to USD 360\u202fbn) back up the claim that there is a large, growing market waiting for these displaced manufacturers.

The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean\u2011reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12\u2011month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account/GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money\u2011supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value.\n\nFigure\u202f5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999\u20112013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each sub\u2011component would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12\u2011month forward returns.\n\nFigure\u202f6 shows the same m\u2011cap weighted results.\n\nOverall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand\u2011alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly fr",

In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey\u2011West T\u2011stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the serial correlation.\n\nTable\u202f2 \u2013 Earnings Yield alone:\nBeta = 3.75, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 7.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 12.01.\n\nTable\u202f3 \u2013 Macro alone (normalized to one sigma):\nBeta = 10.47, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 1.1\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 6.37. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor.\n\nTable\u202f4 \u2013 Combined model:\nEarnings Yield Beta = 3.71, Macro Beta = 9.74, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 8.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stats = 11.86 (Earnings Yield) and 6.27 (Macro).\n\nThe combined regression shows that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone.\n\nConclusions:\n\u2022 D&M\u2019s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth.\n\u2022 We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past.\n\u2022 The finding that countries with poor GDP growth over the past 5\u202fyears outperform was simply an artifact of those countries being cheaper; the fallen\u2011currency effect and the future\u2011GDP effect remain strong after adjusting for value.\n\u2022 Using sliced PE performed better than dividend yield.\n\u2022 Our new macro model works on a stand\u2011alone basis and, more importantly, represents a genuine enhancement to our value\u2011based country\u2011picking process.\n\nEvelyn Huang\nArjun Divecha\n\nINTERNAL ONLY: Not for external distribution",

The presentation opens with a metaphorical title, \u201cReading the Xi Leaves,\u201d signalling that the upcoming analysis will interpret President Xi\u2019s policy signals much like a reader deciphers the subtle patterns in tea leaves. The agenda quickly moves to a historical overview of China\u2019s \u201cprincipal contradiction\u201d \u2013 a concept first mentioned by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and formally codified by the Party in 1981. A timeline of contradictions (1948: capitalism vs. socialism; 1956: economic and cultural growth lagging demand; 1958: ideological struggle; 1981: material and cultural needs vs. backward production; 2017: imbalanced development vs. people\u2019s growing desire for a better life) illustrates how the Party\u2019s focus has shifted from pure growth to a more nuanced balance of quality, equity, and strategic security. \n\nThe \u201cChinese Dream\u201d \u2013 national rejuvenation \u2013 is framed as a tantalisingly reachable goal, illustrated with a chart showing China\u2019s GDP as a share of the United States rising from near\u2011zero in the 1980s to roughly 70\u202f% by 2021. Yet the presenter warns that a policy shift is required to sustain this ascent. Xi\u2019s 2017 speech is quoted: \u201cWhat we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people\u2019s ever\u2011growing needs for a better life.\u201d This sets up three strategic objectives: (1) Reduce inequality \u2013 China\u2019s Gini\u2011type inequality is among the world\u2019s highest; (2) Address the demographic time\u2011bomb \u2013 a rapidly ageing population; (3) Prioritise strategic industries \u2013 technology, batteries, semiconductors, and automation to secure supply chains and achieve self\u2011sufficiency. \n\nThe slides then drill into each objective. For ineq",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nuality, the presenter lists concrete policy levers: curb real\u2011estate speculation (Evergrande), narrow education quality gaps (TAL, EDU), rein in tech giants (Alibaba, Alipay), and improve employee protections (Meituan). For demographics, the analysis shows a 2\u202f% annual growth drag from a declining labour force, backed by IMF and Wind data, and presents a stark forecast: births fell to 12\u202fmillion in 2020 (47\u202f% of the 1987 peak) and could dip to 5\u202fmillion by 2040. A bar chart of factors influencing child\u2011bearing (education cost, housing price, medical expenses, etc.) underscores the social pressures. \n\nStrategic industry priorities are illustrated with a simple table of sectors (batteries, EVs, semiconductors, automation) and the \u201cuseless\u201d activities the Party may curb (gaming, short\u2011video). The presenter then uses a vivid analogy \u2013 \u201cThe Party Giveth and the Party Taketh Away\u201d \u2013 to question whether current market leaders (e.g., China Mobile) will survive regulatory swings. A line chart of China Mobile\u2019s ROE from 2000\u20112020, paired with a commentary excerpt, demonstrates how state\u2011driven regulation can rapidly reshape fortunes. \n\nRegulation and state support are portrayed as a double\u2011edged sword: massive gains for favoured sectors, severe losses for those that fall out of favour. The presenter\u2019s personal voice appears in a reminder: \u201cNever forget my first rule of EM investing.\u201d The slide deck concludes this section with a framework for evaluating sectors against the Chinese Dream\u2019s pillars (social impact, security, state control, etc.), scoring examples such as auto\u2011EV (+1 on most dimensions) versus e\u2011commerce (\u20114). The overall tone is a blend of data\u2011driven analysis, strategic analogy, and a conversational, advisory voice aimed at guiding portfolio managers on how to modulate China exposure within an EM context.",
      "model_response": "The presenter\u2019s personal voice emerges in analogies (\u201cIt\u2019s not about how hard you hit but the frequency with which you hit\u201d) and data\u2011driven assertions (e.g., China\u2019s corporate tax rate is 25\u202f% vs. 20\u202f% in the United States). However, the narrative occasionally stumbles \u2013 a factual error about the PRC corporate tax rate (correctly stated as 25\u202f% but the presentation later notes that the actual rate is around 20\u202f% after rebates) and a grammatical slip (\u201cthe medium\u2011term peak of the labor force is likely to occur in 2025\u201d). Despite these quibbles, the section builds a compelling case for active, interventionist policy. \n\nThe \u201cDemographic Time\u2011Bomb\u201d section uses a simple line graph to show the labour force as a share of the population, highlighting a steep decline after 2015. The presenter connects this to risks for consumer and real\u2011estate sectors, reinforcing the idea that demand will shrink. However, the analysis could benefit from counter\u2011points \u2013 are oil\u2011producing countries indeed on a clear path to electrification, for example, or are they heavily dependent on proven reserves? The presenter\u2019s voice is confident but occasionally lacks the data\u2011backing and balanced perspective that would elevate this to top\u2011class investment analysis.

The latter half of the presentation focuses on investment opportunities outside of China, using a country\u2011sector framework to identify markets and sectors that are well\u2011positioned to benefit from the",

The narrative stresses that the U.S.\u2013China \u201cEconomic War\u201d is a long\u2011run battle over technology, military power, and ideology, and that the combined weight of Taiwan and China represents roughly half of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, creating a negative net effect for that asset class. Memories of Covid\u201119 disruptions and climate\u2011change\u2011induced shocks further motivate diversification. The slide concludes that there is no single \u201cone\u2011stop\u201d alternative to China; instead, on\u2011shoring, near\u2011shoring, and friend\u2011shoring each present distinct investment opportunities, with the presenter focusing on the latter two.\n\nSlide\u202f3 asks why China has fallen out of favor, listing six factors: (1) demographics \u2013 labor\u2011force growth has turned negative after the one\u2011child policy; (2) capitalism \u2013 Deng\u2019s market\u2011opening reforms are being rolled back under Xi; (3) access to global markets \u2013 once expanded by Nixon\u2019s opening and WTO membership, now constrained by Western restrictions; (4) competence \u2013 decision\u2011making has shifted from collective mandarins to a more centralized Xi; (5) Covid\u201119; (6) \u201cKilling the golden geese,\u201d a metaphor for policy missteps that erode China\u2019s competitive advantage; plus housing issues and the \u201cbiggest failure of all \u2013 Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSlide\u202f4 presents a chart from The Economist showing a steep rise in Chinese manufacturing labor costs per hour, underscoring the cost\u2011driven incentive to look elsewhere.\n\nSlide\u202f5 cites BofA Global Research and AlphaSense, noting that corporate presentations increasingly mention re\u2011/near\u2011/on\u2011shoring as supply\u2011chain strategies.\n\nSlide\u202f6\u20117 display a historical line graph (1994\u20112019) of the share of total U.S. goods imports coming from China, highlighting inflection points such as China\u2019s WTO entry, the trade war, and NAFTA. The share has been declining, indicating that the re\u2011allocation is already underway.\n\nSlide\u202f8 introduces a country\u2011framework matrix (Export Structure, Economic Impact, Domestic Market Size, Institutional Capacity, Companies Relocating, Labor & Demographics) used to evaluate alternative locations.\n\nSlide\u202f9 asks \u201cWho benefits from supply chains diversifying out of China?\u201d and sets up the analysis of emerging\u2011market institutions (Slide\u202f10\u201113) that will rank countries as \u201cTop\u201d or \u201cBottom\u201d across the framework dimensions. The slides list a long set of candidate nations (Czech Republic, Poland, Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, etc.) and categorize them by labor\u2011demographic strengths.\n\nOverall, this chunk weaves together a narrative, a metaphor (\u201cKilling the golden geese\u201d), and multiple data visualisations (labor\u2011cost chart, import\u2011share trend, country\u2011framework). It also contains the presenter\u2019s voice (\u201cWe present a strategy\u2026\u201d) and several memorable phrases.",

The framework evaluates Export Structure in Place, Impact on Economy, Domestic Market Size, Institutional Capacity to Attract Investment, Labor & Demographics, Climate & Land Use, Distance from Core Markets, Port & Logistics, Companies Moving Out, Total Impact = Most attractive countries are those that have a heavy dependence on Chinese imports, so that China\u2019s exodus will have a large impact on their economy. India is the most attractive country to benefit from this exodus, based on high dependence on Chinese imports, a large economy that could absorb the manufacturing shift, and a young, growing labor force. Mexico is the least attractive, based on its already diversified economy and strong bond with the US. A country needs to have a heavy dependence on Chinese imports to be a big winner. If a country\u2019s economy is not dependent on China, companies moving away from China will not have a large impact on it. Thus, companies that are highly export\u2011dependent are the ones that will benefit the most from this move. Countries that import little from China will not be affected. The model shows that India could grow its manufacturing output from $63\u202fbn to $137\u202fbn\u202f/\u202f+130\u202f% in 5 years, while Mexico\u2019s would fall from $131\u202fbn",
