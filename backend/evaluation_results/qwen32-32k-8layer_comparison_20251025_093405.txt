Emerging Thoughts
September 2002
Lessons From the Asia Crisis
“If You Allow Capitalism to Work, It Does”
Since 1998 we have maintained the U.S. had the potential of being the “Asia crisis writ large”. In both cases the bubble was caused by overcapacity financed with “cheap” capital, overvalued markets encouraged by accommodating central bankers and overpriced currencies driven by massive foreign direct and portfolio investment. 
While the Asia crisis has largely played out, we are in the early stages of the unraveling of the U.S. bubble. This “Emerging Thoughts” piece focuses on lessons we learned from living through the Asia crisis and it’s aftermath in the hope that it may provide insights to U.S. investors facing a similar situation.
Lesson xx: How much a market has fallen does not give you a clue as to much further it could fall. To wit; 
“Q: How does one characterize a market that has fallen 90%?”
“A: It first fell 80% and then halved.”
In short, the fact that the NASDAQ has fallen 75% from it’s peak doesn’t mean it’s a good buy.
Lesson xx: Where has the big money been made post crisis? Market leaders that gained a competitive advantage by their weaker rivals going out of business. Land and House example, Shinsegae example
Lesson xx: People focus on yesterday’s news ( accounting etc.)  but market/regulators force changes in management/practices. Thus focus less on management but on fundamental assets/ competitive advantages of the business. 
Lesson xx: Catching a falling safe
Lesson xx: Markets can stagnate for a long time. Despite getting it right, Thai market is still stuck in a trading band which is 80% below peak levels. Confidence takes along time to come back.
Lesson xx: Have seen large bear market rallies. Keep your powder dry.

Okay, so I need to write an investment analysis based on the article "Lessons From the Asia Crisis" from September 2002, specifically focusing on the quote "If You Allow Capitalism to Work, It D..." from Learn Liberty. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Asian financial crisis. It happened in the late 1990s, right? Countries like Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and others experienced severe economic downturns due to currency devaluations, banking crises, and stock market collapses. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) got involved, providing loans but with strict conditions, which were controversial.

The article's main point seems to be about the lessons learned from that crisis, particularly regarding how capitalism functions when allowed to operate without excessive interference. The quote suggests that if capitalism is allowed to work properly, it can lead to positive outcomes, but during the crisis, there might have been interventions or structures that hindered its natural processes. 

So, for an investment analysis, I need to connect the lessons from the crisis to investment strategies, risks, and opportunities. Let me break down possible points:

1. **Understanding the Crisis**: Briefly explain what happened during the Asian crisis. High levels of foreign debt, overleveraged corporations, fixed exchange rates that became unsustainable, and then the domino effect when one country (Thailand) devalued its currency, leading to a regional crisis.

2. **Role

GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, Stays in Emerging Arjun Divecha The Opportunity We have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets. In the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4 trillion and daily trading volume of around $40 billion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets. While there are many ways to segment emerging markets – by region, big cap vs. small cap, value vs. growth – we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure. In recent years, there has been much talk about the coupling/decoupling of emerging markets vis-à-vis the developed world. We fi nd this either/or characterization misses the mark when, in fact, the reality is far more complicated. Perhaps a better way to think about growth in emerging markets is to characterize it as having two components: correlated growth, which is driven by links with the developed world, and uncorrelated growth, which depends more on the internal dynamics and demographics of the emerging markets themselves. From this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalized world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a “seven lean years” scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a “pure play” on the economic growth of these countries. The Case for Domestic Demand Looking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors. In addition, because they compete globally, margins are likely to be squeezed by having to go toe-to-toe with well-capitalized global competitors. 2 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Global commodity producers may continue to do well (as they have over the previous decade) if commodity prices stay high or rise even further. For most institutional investors, it makes sense to have an overall commodity strategy with commodity producers from emerging markets in the mix. However, we do not believe that they represent an emerging “pure play” as they are driven by global rather than purely emerging market forces. The main case for the domestic demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confl uence of two forces: economics and demographics. The Economic Case The economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging market countries arriving at the “sweet spot,” where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries begin to get richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. For example, we have seen savings rates in emerging markets rise from 13% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35% today (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1 Savings Rates Have Risen with Income in Emerging Markets However, once per capita GDP levels reach the range of $3,000 to $10,000, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. We believe that this occurs for two reasons. First, at these levels of national wealth, societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets. Second, individuals have newfound discretionary income, which they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this “sweet spot” of $3,000 to $10,000 per capita GDP and then drop. Exhibit 2 shows this pattern in a number of developed markets as they became richer. In recent years, we have seen the same pattern repeated in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, Israel, etc. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Savings Rate Mean Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 3 Exhibit 2 However, Savings Rates Drop Dramatically When GDP/Capita Reaches the $3,000-$10,000 Range We've Seen This in Developed Markets at a Similar Stage of Development Korea Savings Rate vs. Per Capita GDP 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Portugal 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Japan -20 0 20 40 60 80 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Greece 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Australia 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 $0 $5,000 $10,000 $15,000 $20,000 $25,000 Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO 4 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 What makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50% of emerging market countries (by market cap) are in this sweet spot (Exhibit 3). This was not the case 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago. Thus, if economic growth remains strong in emerging markets, one can reasonably expect to see large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending. Exhibit 3 50% of Emerging Countries Are Now in the Sweet Spot of Shifting from Savings to Consumption While a number of sell-side analysts suggest that this story is already well-known and priced into markets, we beg to differ. We believe when incomes reach this sweet spot, the elasticity of demand becomes highly non-linear, where small increases in per capita income lead to large increases in consumption. A simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In the year 2000, Chinese crossed $1,000 per capita GDP. In that year, auto sales fi rst exceeded 1 million vehicles. Ten years later, Chinese GDP more than quadrupled, to $4,400 per capita. What happened to auto sales? Did they go from 1 million to 4 million? No. They went from 1 million to 17 million! No analyst that we know of predicted anything close to these numbers. It’s very diffi cult to forecast this kind of growth, so high growth forecasts tend to be 20% to 30% at each point in time, followed by upward revisions on a regular basis. As a result of these factors, we are reasonably confi dent that per capita consumption in emerging market countries will rise substantially in the next few years and that much of this consumption growth is not anticipated by markets. The Demographic Shift What makes an already good story potentially explosive is the fact that demographics are not static and indicate that the number of people in their prime working (and consuming) years will also rise dramatically in the next few years (both in absolute terms and relative to the developed markets). Exhibit 4 shows the dependency ratio, which is defi ned as the ratio of non-working-age to working-age people in both the emerging and developed markets. As the downward sloping line shows, demographics in emerging markets have improved dramatically over the last few years (with the dependency ratio falling) and they will remain in this sweet spot for the next few decades. What this means is that the number of people that are working relative to those not working has dramatically improved and will remain there for the next 20 to 30 years. (Obviously, this is not true for all emerging market countries. Eastern Europe’s and China’s dependency ratios deteriorate quite rapidly over the next 25 years, while those of India, Indonesia, and Turkey improve.) Weight in S&P/IFCI Composite Index 2005 2010 Less than $3,000 per capita GDP 19% 13% Between $3,000 and $10,000 per capita GDP 41% 50% Greater than $10,000 per capita GDP 40% 36% Source: S&P/IFC, EIU, World Bank. GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 5 Exhibit 4 Growth: Demographics Play An Important Role Improvement in Demographics Has Played a Signifi cant Role in Increased Growth Rates Conversely, as baby boomers retire in the developed world, the dependency ratio will worsen and there will be fewer workers (as a proportion of the population) and the overall number of hours worked will decrease. The overall global effect will be to shift consumption (as a result of increasing income) from the developed world to the emerging world. Economic Changes + Demographic Shift = Huge Increase in Consumer Base With these global shifts in economics and demographics upon us, the focus of economic activity is likely to shift toward domestic demand providers within emerging markets. Exhibit 5 shows the number of people that one might term “middle class” (defi ned as having an income greater than $6,000) that will be added to the emerging markets over the next fi ve years (assuming the continuation of current growth rates). This number is far greater than the current population of the United States. We are very confi dent that, absent some global catastrophe, domestic demand in emerging market countries will be robust over the next few years, irrespective of what may or may not happen in the developed world. So, what could derail this story? The most likely candidate is oil rising to $200/barrel and staying there for an extended period. In general, very high commodity prices would have a major impact on consumption in emerging markets, and would shift potential return from domestic demand companies to commodity producers. * Percent of non-working to working people. Source: United Nations 6 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Exhibit 5 If Current Trends Persist, the Emerging Middle Class Will Increase by around 500 Million People in the Next 5 Years How Does One Take Advantage of This? Recently, we’ve been asked by a number of our clients if this anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue – the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities. At this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets and thus most multinationals do not represent a “pure play” on emerging domestic demand. For example, if we screen the MS World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50% of their sales from emerging markets, we fi nd 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574 billion and make up only 2.1% of the market value of the MSCI World Index. Exhibit 6 shows the 10 largest companies in this group – not exactly the household names one expects to see. -370 463 80 -500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Less than $6,000 (Below Middle Class) $6,000 to $30,000 (Middle Class) More Than $30,000 Millions Emerging Markets – Change in Consumer Base 2010-2015 70% of Europe Population Source: Goldman Sachs, World Bank GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 7 Exhibit 6 In addition, our view is that locally-domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home-fi eld advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from numerous sources, including high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well-established local brands, government policies that tend to favor locals, and the fact that local competitors are likely to have high profi tability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend – rather than build – their market share. A good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to be able to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia, it would be extremely expensive. In addition, they would have great diffi culty competing against a well-established player such as Magnit, which runs 4,000 plus stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20% (both of which allow it to make life very diffi cult for new entrants). We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build out its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where they paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefi ts of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future. This is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long-standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in countries like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profi tability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally-listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade-off between “pure-play” and valuation. For example, Domino’s Pizza has a market cap of $1.6 billion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3 billion, despite contributing less than 10% of the sales and 18% of the profi ts of the overall company. If our thesis of home fi eld advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past 5 years. Exhibit 7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive from a valuation point of view relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit 8 shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason domestic emerging companies outperformed was because their earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion. Name Country Market Value ($M) % Sales to EM QUALCOMM Inc.

As of 7/31/11 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 9 At the end of the day (as we mentioned earlier), it’s not about multinationals versus locals, but which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profi ts that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we fi nd that the best (but not all) opportunities are local. Not All Domestic Opportunities Are Attractive Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Similarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profi tability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profi tability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15 million net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profi tability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. Thus, high growth in this sector is unlikely to translate into high returns for shareholders. On the other hand, the fi nancial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well-established, highly profi table banks. Only 2% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefi t from this growth without having to lower their margins. The key is to look for fast-growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows for players to have high profi tability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profi tability in the face of non-linear demand increases are most attractive. Profi tability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter. In GMO parlance – focus on quality within fast-growing country/sectors. Conclusions As a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe that we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in the emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be refl ected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers. The winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home-fi eld advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well-established, high quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast-growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.

What Happens in Emerging, Stagnant, and Mature Markets?
Emerging consumers are the key to global economic growth and will be for the foreseeable future. The global middle class is expanding, and with it, the demand for goods and services. The emerging consumer is not just a new consumer but a new type of consumer who is different from the traditional consumer in the developed world. The emerging consumer is younger, more urban, and more connected. They are also more price-sensitive and more brand-conscious. The emerging consumer is driving demand for a wide range of products and services, from fast food to luxury goods.
The emerging consumer is also changing the way businesses operate. Companies are having to adapt their products and marketing strategies to appeal to this new consumer. This is leading to a shift in

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The text you've provided seems to be a partial or incomplete title or outline for an analysis on emerging markets (EM) investment insights. The key pillars mentioned are:

1. **Market Cap/Liquidity**  
2. **Addressable Market**  
3. **Growth**

Small-cap stocks may offer higher growth potential but come with higher risk and lower liquidity.
- **Liquidity Risk:** In EMs, liquidity can dry up quickly during periods of global stress or local crises. Investors need to be cautious about the ability to exit positions quickly, especially in smaller or less developed markets.
- **Index Inclusion:** The inclusion of EM equities in global indices (e

(Please provide as much detail as possible) China and Beyond China What's your perspective on the investment insights | Arjun Divecha | 1 FROM CHINA TO BEYOND China has become less attractive. In my view, China is at a major juncture. It’s a bit rich for governments to use the term “new normal” but from an economic point of view, there is a new normal for China. In the past, China’s economic model was based on the ability to set and execute policy and get things done. However, there was a lack of middle-income consumption. The consumption of the middle-income group was not a big part of the economy. Now, with a large and emerging middle-income group, consumption is becoming an important part of the economy. In my view, this creates a major challenge for the Chinese government. They need to decide whether to use state-directed investment to prop up the economy or to allow the natural shift of middle-income consumption to drive the economy. The first option will lead to overcapacity while the second will lead to a more sustainable economy. If the former is chosen, it will lead to poor investment decisions with overcapacity in sectors like real estate, steel, etc. The latter will allow for a more natural shift, where consumption drives the economy. In both cases, the former will be beneficial for the producers of steel, cement, etc. The latter will be good for consumer-oriented companies. In the new normal, it’s not clear

Write an investment analysis on the topic discussed in this excerpt: GMO EMERGING THOUGHTS January 2011 Ruminations on China and India Arjun Divecha China: If you build ... (Please provide a detailed analysis)

EXPECTED ANSWER:
<think>

</think>

GMO EMERGING THOUGHTS January 2011 Ruminations on China and India Arjun Divecha China: If you build it, they will come… India: You’re not going to build it, but they’ll come anyway… I t occurred to me that this is a good metaphor for China and India and the resulting implications for growth and investment return. Last month I had a long chat with one of the people in China whose views I most respect. He is extremely plugged in with the fi nancial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefi t. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions. In my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and fi nancial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today. That, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long-term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital? One of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see “China’s Red Flags” by Edward Chancellor) so I won’t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high-speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure fi nancial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high-speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high-speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high-speed rail in expansive continental geographies. In short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital. Now, let’s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply – too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have diffi cult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years). The one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that’s because it’s the one policy the government actually got right – by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song). As you may guess, 2 GMO Ruminations on China and India – January 2011 Disclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of Arjun Divecha and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions. This is not an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of any security and should not be construed as such. References to specific securities and issuers are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to be, and should not be interpreted as, recommendations to purchase or sell such securities. The portfolio weightings are current only as of the date indicated and are subject to change. none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profi ts by investing in telecoms outside of India. This is what makes for the true irony of India – that bad policy has led to high profi ts because producers benefi ted from shortages. Another interesting consequence of bad policy-making (India consistently runs high budget defi cits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high-return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefi ts investors by delivering high return on investment. Now this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us – is it possible that investing in India benefi ts from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high- cost-of-capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth. I believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India’s ability to grow. We already see infl ation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High infl ation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high-infl ation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs. Nevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom- up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state-directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profi t- maximizers. In the fi nal analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profi tability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors. In short, don’t focus on growth. Focus on profi tability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation – we are willing to pay a premium for profi tability, but not to overpay for it. Current positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring infl ation down, a task that is made much harder by the profl igate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The title of this piece is "If you build it, will they come?" and it is a discussion of the Chinese government's plan to build a massive amount of infrastructure in the next 5 years, including 100,000 km of new roads, 15,000 km of high-speed rail, 100 new airports, and 100 million new housing units. The author is skeptical of the plan, noting that China's debt is growing and that the plan may not be sustainable. The author also notes that the plan may be more about creating jobs and maintaining social stability than about economic growth. The author is also skeptical of the plan's impact on the environment and on the quality of life for Chinese citizens. The author concludes that the plan may be a "sugar high" for the Chinese economy and that the long-term consequences may be negative.

India: The author is more optimistic about India's economic prospects, noting that India's growth is more organic and less reliant on government stimulus. The author also notes that India's demographic dividend is a significant advantage, and that India's services sector is growing. The author is also more optimistic about India's ability to manage its debt and to maintain social stability. The author concludes that India is a better long-term investment than China.

Below is a detailed **investment analysis** on the topic discussed in the excerpt from GMO EMERGING THOUGHTS, January 2011, titled **Ruminations on China and India: China: If you build ...**. This analysis focuses on the key themes and implications for investors. --- # **GMO Emerging Thoughts January 2011 Investment Analysis China: If you Build It, Will They Come?** ## **Introduction** In the 2011 paper, Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. (GMO) EMERGING THOUGHTS publication titled “Ruminations on China and India”, Arjun Divecha presents a comprehensive analysis of China’s economic transformation and its investment implications. The central theme, “If you build it, will they come?” poses a critical question about China’s economic future: If the country builds advanced infrastructure and increases its productive capacity, will domestic demand grow enough to absorb all this excess? This analysis explores China’s economic challenges, policy responses, and what investors should consider when evaluating the country’s investment landscape. --- ## **Economic Backdrop in 2011 China in 2011 was often described as emerging from the global financial crisis but still dependent on export-led growth.

Question
Analyze the market implications of the concept presented here: | 2 BEYOND CHINA | 3 WHY “BEYOND CHINA”? First they were emerging markets…
During the early 2000s, a new wave of global economic growth was driven by the rise of the so-called "emerging markets." These were countries with growing economies and expanding middle classes, and they were seen as the next big thing in global business. The most prominent among them was China, which experienced rapid economic growth and became a major manufacturing hub. As a result, many companies shifted their production and sourcing strategies to take advantage of China's low labor costs and vast supply chain capabilities.
However, over the past decade, the dynamics of global trade and manufacturing have changed significantly. Geopolitical tensions, trade wars, and the rise of protectionism have made it increasingly difficult for companies to rely solely

| 2 BEYOND CHINA | WHY “BEYOND CHINA”? First they were emerging markets… During the early 200s, all roads led to Rome (and emerging markets). Large parts of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America had rudimentary capital markets which suddenly became highly attractive to global investors. The emerging markets trade was based on the assumption that countries which had not fully participated in the financial system would become integrated with it, resulting in significant growth. Emerging markets had unique local conditions, such as low labor cost, that would fuel their economic growth. As a result, it became extremely lucrative for global investors to pour money into emerging markets. | 3 WHY “BEYOND CHINA” | 4 WHY “BEYOND CHINA”? China’s central role Now, emerging markets have matured. The much-quoted Chinese economy became the largest in the world (by some measures) and its companies now compete globally. In addition, countries such as India, Indonesia and Brazil have large domestic markets with their own native companies. These companies have grown not only within their own countries, but now compete globally. Thus, the focus has shifted from “emerging markets” to “Beyond China”. This new term reflects the post China- centric world. Companies and countries are no longer emerging; they’re beyond that. They have their own competitive advantages, their own strengths, their own assets. The term “Beyond China” allows us to think about the largest

Emerging Thoughts April 2018: Russia
“Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is,
Do you, Mr. Jones?”
Bob Dylan, Ballad of a Thin Man
That’s what it kind of feels like today, that there’s something going on behind the scenes beyond the obvious, but we are not privy to it.
The Russian market fell 10% on the back of new US sanctions and a chemical weapon attack in Syria. This is a much larger reaction than one would have expected. It’s not clear that the two situations (sanctions and Syria) are linked, but the market perceives that the risk of a major blowup with Russia (maybe Iran or North Korea style sanctions) has increased dramatically. We don’t buy it.
Our sources in Washington tell us that the new sanctions (and their timing) were a complete surprise to everyone in congress – that this was purely a White House operation. The fact that Mr. Oleg Deripaska (who is closely associated with Mr. Paul Manafort) and companies he controls was the main target would suggest that there’s a political dimension to this. If the intent was to hurt Russia economically, sanctioning companies such as Gazprom, Sberbank and Lukoil would have had a much more profound impact. Our sources in Moscow also suggest a similar view.
The new risk is that the White House is now actively involved with day to day Russia policy and everyone is uncertain as to what Mr. Trump might tweet tomorrow.
In short we don’t think the US is exercising the “nuclear option” of trying to tank the Russian economy and this action does not signal movement in that direction. While this action will cause pain in certain areas, we do not think it has a profound impact on the Russian economy. As a result, we are quite comfortable with our overweight in Russian equites, who continue to be extremely cheap.
Within the Russian market, Gazprom fell 8% while Sberbank fell almost 22%. Gazprom is very unlikely to be sanctioned because it supplies 30% of Europe’s natural gas and so makes sense that it would be less affected. 
On the other hand, we believe Sberbank’s dramatic fall reflects the fact that it is the most foreigner owned and most liquid Russian stock (the GDR trades an average of $100 million daily in London alone) and was hard hit for liquidity rather than fundamental reasons. Sberbank has only 3% of its assets exposed to companies that were sanctioned. It is Russia’s largest bank, with 20,000 branches and 65% of all deposits in the country. It trades at 5 times current earnings, 1.3 times book value while earning 23% return on equity. It is one of the largest positions in our portfolio and we are adding to it.

The concept presented in the April 2018 Emerging Thoughts report on Russia, titled “Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is...”, suggests a sense of uncertainty and potential transformation within the Russian market and geopolitical landscape. This phrase, borrowed from Bob Dylan’s song “It’s Alright, Ma (If I’m Allowed to Be),” evokes a feeling of underlying change or upheaval that is not yet fully understood or recognized by the broader public or market participants. In the context of Russia in 2018, this could refer to several key developments and trends that were beginning to take shape but whose full implications were not yet clear.

### 1. **Geopolitical Tensions and Sanctions**
In 2018, Russia was still under the shadow of Western sanctions imposed in response to its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its involvement in the conflict in Ukraine. These sanctions had a significant impact on the Russian economy, particularly in sectors such as energy, finance, and defense. The Emerging Thoughts report may be alluding to the fact that while the immediate effects of these sanctions were visible, the long-term structural changes they would bring to the Russian economy and its integration with global markets were still unfolding. The uncertainty here is twofold: whether Russia would adapt and find alternative trade partners, and whether the West would continue or escalate sanctions in response to further geopolitical moves.

That’s the first line of the 1962 song “Eve Of The

my Emerging Thoughts for April 2018. In that
song, Bob Dylan is addressing Mr. Jones, who
represents the everyman. It’s a song about how
the media and government are feeding us

new world order. It’s about how everything
seems to be going along normally, but there’s
this feeling that something is about to change.
That we are on the “eve of the detective”

talk about this month. “Because something is
happening here but you don't know what it is,

during the Cold War, a time when the threat of
nuclear war was very present. The song
resonates with our current times. In 2018, we
are sleepwalking into a new world order
where technology is changing at an

EXPECTED ANSWER:

Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country picking strategies for EM, from 1976-2013. Figure 1 shows their results for equal weighted portfolios. Figure 1 There are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn – first, that value works (they use Div Yield as the proxy for value) to predict one year return. Second, that reversion strategies work – countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5 years. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12 month local real return) don’t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5 years GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1 year return. What We Did: First of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money. Figure 2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993- 2013. Figure 2 The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes. Figure 3 shows the same study, but now using square root mcap to define the quintiles and mcap weighting within each quintile. Figure 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Equal Weight 0 5 10 15 20 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Mcap Weight Again the results don’t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts). Since we think of value is being something different from Div Yield, we re-ran the equal weighted analysis replacing Div Yield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure 4 shows the results – clearly earnings yield works even better than Div Yield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone. Figure 4 Disentangling the effects: Looking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value – after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap. In order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12 month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value. Table 1 shows the T-stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non-overlapping periods). Table 1 T-Stat DivYld CtrySize Ret_1yrReal FXreturn GDP5yr GDPnext5yr Adjusted R^2 Just Yield 4.57 4.8% Yield and Country Size 4.71 1.38 5.0% Yield and Trailing 12 Month Return 4.31 -3.28 7.0% Yield and Currency Return 4.54 -2.34 5.8% Yield and Past 5Yr GDP Growth 4.47 -0.96 4.7% Yield and Future 5Yr GDP Growth 5.06 3.78 7.8% The one clear conclusion is that Past 5Yr GDP growth is a proxy for value – adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T-stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don’t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return. How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework? Last year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables – our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon – Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12 month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account /GDP (which we’ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value. Figure 5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999-2013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each subcomponent would have worked.

We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T-stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey-West T-stats, which (I’m told) correct for the serial correlation. Table 2 shows the regression for Earnings Yield by itself, which shows that for one extra unit of earnings yield; historically you got an extra 3.75% return. Table 2 Earnings Yield Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.75 7.0% T-Stat 12.01 Table 3 shows the same for Macro, with an additional unit exposure to this factor (its a normalized variable for one unit is one sigma) adding 10.47% return. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor Table 3 Macro Adjusted R- Squared Beta 10.47 1.1% T- Stat 6.37 Finally, when we combine both, we see that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone. Table 4 Earnings Yield Macro Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.71 9.74 8.0% T-Stat 11.86 6.27 Conclusions: D&M’s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth. We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past. In addition we found that one of D&M’s results, countries that had poor GDP growth over the past 5 years outperform, was simply an artifact of the fact those countries were cheaper. However, the fallen currency effect and the future GDP effects remain strong even after adjusting for value. We found that using sliced PE performed better than Div yield. Finally we looked at how our new Macro model would have done using this framework and concluded that it worked on a standalone basis, but more importantly did indeed represent an enhancement to our value models for picking countries.

Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited
What D&M Did:
Dimson and Marsh did an extensive study of the performance of emerging markets from 1988 to 2002. They looked at the performance of 18 countries and found that the average annual return was 12.4% in local currency terms and 10.3% in U.S. dollar terms. They also found that the volatility of returns was high, with an average annual standard deviation of 23.8% in local currency and 21.3% in U.S. dollar terms. They concluded that the high returns were not worth the high risk and that investors should be cautious when investing in emerging markets.
What D&M Didn't Do:
Dimson and Marsh did not consider the impact of diversification on the risk and return of emerging market investments. They also did not consider the impact of currency risk on the returns of emerging market investments. They also did not consider the impact of the time period on the results. The period from 1988 to 2002 was a period of high volatility and uncertainty, which may have affected the results.
What We Did:
We revisited the D&M study and considered the impact of diversification

Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an article titled “Investing in the Equity Markets of Emerging Countries: Lessons From the Past” in 1996. Their study covered the period spanning 1976 to 1993, analyzing the annual gross dollar returns of emerging markets. D&M’s goal was to investigate the effectiveness of passive versus active strategies: more specifically, if investing in all emerging countries (passive) was wiser than picking a few of them (active). Their conclusion: “If the task is to predict which emerging countries will do best over the next 5 to 10 years, it makes little sense to focus on any particular subset of them. Instead, PRS recommends investing in all of them.” In short, they concluded that emerging markets did not conform to the efficient market theory. Therefore, picking winners and losers was difficult. Instead, they recommended a passive strategy. What’s Changed: Dimson and Marsh’s study is now 20 years old. We’ve had the rise of China and India. Emerging markets have become an important part of the world’s GDP and are no longer a fringe of the global economy. In addition, we have had massive problems like the Asian crisis (of 1998) and the Global Financial Crisis (of 2008). How does this affect things?

Emerging Thoughts: Policy Paralysis in India
India is grinding to a halt. Well, not all of India, but an important part of it which depends on government policy action. The reason is corruption and scandals associated with government officials taking bribes.
Corruption has been endemic in India since the time of independence in 1947 (and maybe well before that as well). What’s different this time is that the media have been exposing this corruption and on the back of these revelations people (more specifically senior politicians and billionaires) are being put in jail and staying there.

Firstly, let’s look at what’s happening in the, government. There are a number of important files on which action is needed, but they are remaining pending with ministers. The reason is corruption and scandals associated with these files. Ministers are afraid of being exposed, so they are not taking action. They are passing the buck.

EXPECTED ANSWER:

GMO North America | Europe | Australasia Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 “Dude, Where’s My Alpha?” Arjun Divecha Over the last 4 years we’ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term. We examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we’re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it. Country Selection – How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries? Chart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid 1998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative underperformance over the next 12 months. What this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen. Chart 1: How Cheap Are Cheap Countries? Cheap Countries Are Relatively Expensive 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Value of Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries Narrow Spread Wide Spread Normally Trade at a 22% Discount Current Discount: 15% Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 2 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia What Are We Doing About It? It’s important to note that while value is an important part of our country selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, Macroeconomics and Judgment form 55% of our country selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver outperformance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion. We normally run our country selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets. Stock Picking Within Country – How Cheap Are Value and Small Cap Stocks? Looking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap “value” stocks have been over time, relative to the index. What this chart shows is that value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount, the narrowest we’ve seen in the 15-year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively outperformed. In the last few months we have seen a similar contraction in the positioning of value in the U.S. and developed markets, but not to uncharted waters, which is where we are now in Emerging. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it’s still at a 34% discount)? Chart 2: How Cheap Are Value Stocks? Value Stocks are Relatively Expensive 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Value of Cheap Stocks Relative to Benchmark October 2000: 46% Discount Current: 34% Discount Narrow Spread Wide Spread Normally Trade at 40% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 3 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia We have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure – it’s unlikely to be a good thing. So, if value isn’t attractive, what is? Let’s first look at small cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they’re not as cheap as they usually are either. That’s exactly what Chart 3 shows – the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance. What Are We Doing About It? The question we ask ourselves is, “If value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?” We first looked at “growth” stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive. Another group of stocks we follow quite closely is high quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today. Chart 3: How Cheap Are Small Stocks? Small Stocks Are Fairly Valued 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 1.05 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 October 2000: 32% Discount Current: 12% Discount Normally Trade at 16% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 4 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia GMO’s experience suggests that markets systematically underprice quality. In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low-debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today. Over the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current “Value” model for stock picking with a new “Quality-Adjusted-Value” model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004. Chart 5: Quality Is Relatively Cheap 0.85 0.95 1.05 1.15 1.25 1.35 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Currently: 0% Premium Normally Trade at 9% Premium to Market Jan- Source: GMO Chart 4: How Attractive Are Growth* Stocks? 0.52 0.72 0.92 1.12 1.32 1.52 1.72 1.92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Jan- * Non-loss making companies that are forecast to have the highest 2 year growth Source: GMO Currently: 31% Premium Normally Trade at 23% Premium to Market Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 5 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia In the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider “junky” value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new “Quality-Adjusted-Value” model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts. Finally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that’s precisely why we use both strategies – to diversify each other). Overall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we’ll sleep much easier. What Should You Do About This? So, when you hear from us that our ability to add value is diminished, what’s the appropriate response? When we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset allocation group’s 7-year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset allocation products. Another response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs. Those of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar year end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index1, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way. We’re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don’t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride. 1 The S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index is an independently maintained and published emerging market stock index.

I was at GMO during the time this was written and I was one of the people who helped review the paper. I can’t say I remember the exact details of the paper, but I can say that the basic premise is correct. The paper is about the difficulty of generating alpha in the current market environment and the need for investors to be more realistic about their expectations.

EXPECTED ANSWER:

Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country picking strategies for EM, from 1976-2013. Figure 1 shows their results for equal weighted portfolios. Figure 1 There are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn – first, that value works (they use Div Yield as the proxy for value) to predict one year return. Second, that reversion strategies work – countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5 years. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12 month local real return) don’t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5 years GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1 year return. What We Did: First of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money. Figure 2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993- 2013. Figure 2 The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes. Figure 3 shows the same study, but now using square root mcap to define the quintiles and mcap weighting within each quintile. Figure 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Equal Weight 0 5 10 15 20 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Mcap Weight Again the results don’t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts). Since we think of value is being something different from Div Yield, we re-ran the equal weighted analysis replacing Div Yield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure 4 shows the results – clearly earnings yield works even better than Div Yield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone. Figure 4 Disentangling the effects: Looking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value – after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap. In order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12 month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value. Table 1 shows the T-stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non-overlapping periods). Table 1 T-Stat DivYld CtrySize Ret_1yrReal FXreturn GDP5yr GDPnext5yr Adjusted R^2 Just Yield 4.57 4.8% Yield and Country Size 4.71 1.38 5.0% Yield and Trailing 12 Month Return 4.31 -3.28 7.0% Yield and Currency Return 4.54 -2.34 5.8% Yield and Past 5Yr GDP Growth 4.47 -0.96 4.7% Yield and Future 5Yr GDP Growth 5.06 3.78 7.8% The one clear conclusion is that Past 5Yr GDP growth is a proxy for value – adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T-stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don’t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return. How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework? Last year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables – our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon – Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12 month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account /GDP (which we’ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value. Figure 5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999-2013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each subcomponent would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12 month forward returns. Figure 5 Figure 6 shows the same mcap weighted Figure 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Equal Weight 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Mcap Weight Overall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand-alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T-stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey-West T-stats, which (I’m told) correct for the serial correlation. Table 2 shows the regression for Earnings Yield by itself, which shows that for one extra unit of earnings yield; historically you got an extra 3.75% return. Table 2 Earnings Yield Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.75 7.0% T-Stat 12.01 Table 3 shows the same for Macro, with an additional unit exposure to this factor (its a normalized variable for one unit is one sigma) adding 10.47% return. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor Table 3 Macro Adjusted R- Squared Beta 10.47 1.1% T- Stat 6.37 Finally, when we combine both, we see that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone. Table 4 Earnings Yield Macro Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.71 9.74 8.0% T-Stat 11.86 6.27 Conclusions: D&M’s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth. We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past. In addition we found that one of D&M’s results, countries that had poor GDP growth over the past 5 years outperform, was simply an artifact of the fact those countries were cheaper. However, the fallen currency effect and the future GDP effects remain strong even after adjusting for value. We found that using sliced PE performed better than Div yield. Finally we looked at how our new Macro model would have done using this framework and concluded that it worked on a standalone basis, but more importantly did indeed represent an enhancement to our value models for picking countries.

What D&M Did:
Dimson and Marsh did an extensive study of the performance of emerging markets from 1988 to 2002. They found that the average annual return of the emerging market universe was 12.4 percent, but the average annual return of the best-performing 20 percent of countries was 18.8 percent, and the average annual return of the worst-performing 20 percent of countries was 4.8 percent. The difference between the best and worst was 14 percent per year. The average annual return of the best-performing 40 percent of countries was 16.3 percent, and the average annual return of the worst-performing 40 percent of countries was 8.3 percent. The difference between the best and worst was 8 percent per year. The average annual return of the best-performing 60 percent of countries was 14.8 percent, and the average annual return of the worst-performing 60 percent of countries was 10.0 percent.

What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study on country selection. They used the Global Investment Return Yearbook data for the period ending June 2010. The data they used went from 1976 to 2010. They had data for 28 developed markets, 16 emerging markets, and the world ex-USA and ex-Japan. D&M Methodology: Dimson and Marsh constructed a strategy where the investor had a 5 country limit. The idea was to pick the top 5 countries out of each market segment based on 12, 60 and 120 month returns. The point was to see how these strategies would have worked over time. The point of the exercise was to study whether market selection could have added value if one used a simple strategy like this. Emerging: Emerging markets had positive excess returns (alpha) over the world ex-USA and ex-Japan in all three periods. The strategy of buying the top 5 countries would have added value over the strategy of investing in the world ex-USA and ex-Japan. The results were not true for the developed markets. Developed: The developed markets had positive excess returns in 2 of the 3 periods, but the strategy of buying the top 5 countries would not have

Shooting the Messenger?
On July 2, the 100-year badla system will give away to a T+ 5 compulsory rolling settlement system. While this change is ostensibly geared to creating a more transparent system, the timing of the move reflects paranoia on the part of the authorities and will only exacerbate the bear market. The main casualty has been and will continue to be liquidity!
A liquid stock market enables capital to get allocated quickly and efficiently, benefiting investors, companies and governments.  Today, investors pay significant premiums for liquidity in all equity markets. In an increasingly competitive world for investment dollars, one of the few advantages Indian markets had was liquidity and depth.  Unlike other emerging markets where only a handful of stocks are liquid, India boasted tens of stocks that traded over $100 million a day each; greatly increasing it’s attractiveness to large investors. 
Why does liquidity matter? There are several companies in emerging markets that are more profitable, but more undervalued on any metric when compared to Indian companies. Take an example of Thai Union Frozen - it’s the equivalent of Infosys in the global shrimp business with revenues of $800 million (twice that of Infosys) and profits of $50 million. It has a return on equity of 20% and earnings growth of 15-20% annually. Yet it has a market value of less than $300 million as compared to $8 billion for Infosys. Why is so undervalued? The shrimp business is certainly less sexy than software, but at the end of the day they are both cyclical commodity businesses. The main reason for the difference in value is liquidity as it trades a measly $50,000 to $100,000 a day versus $200 -300 million for Infosys. While it is easy to dismiss Thailand today, lets not forget that in 1994 the market traded over $1 billion a day (when India traded $20-30 million a day).
Implicit in today’s Indian market multiples is a premium for liquidity. As liquidity reduces, it can easily set up a vicious circle leading to valuations for software leaders to drop to 10 to 15 times (or less) earnings. We have already seen this happen with the second and third tier software companies. This effectively increases the cost of capital impacting their global competitiveness. The dream that software exports will reach $80 billion by 2008 will remain just that.
It's easy to want to find scapegoats for a vicious bear market. Bursting the global tech bubble of 1998-2000 caused pain everywhere, not just in India. The high liquidity associated with this bubble may now appear speculative and harmful but lets not forget the benefits that India enjoyed from it. Liquidity enabled a lot of companies to raise cheap capital and improve balance sheets. Today, in the technology downturn this capital will help them survive. The boom in stock prices created unprecedented media publicity for the Indian software story. It resulted in India being on the investment horizon of a lot of institutions that earlier avoided it. 
To Indian regulators, futures and options may seem to be the panacea to cure the evils of badla (of which there are undoubtedly many). However, they have not been successful in any emerging market we know of. The biggest investors in most emerging markets are foreign and domestic mutual funds - they are severely constrained in the use of such derivative instruments. In nascent capital markets, small domestic investors don’t really understand the intricacies of such instruments and end up being losers. Who then will use these derivatives? Ketan Parikh?
SEBI has recently released the list of companies which will have options traded.  Some companies that were trading more than $300 million a day have been excluded, presumably on the ground that they were speculative favourites. Lets not forget that speculation and investment are two sides of the same coin. It's impossible to have one without the other. It should not be the role of the market regulator to decide which stocks should have options (and therefore affect capital allocation) - let the market decide that. If there are then abuses of market manipulation, they should use the existing laws on the books to deal with them.
It’s easy to dismiss successful homegrown systems and go in for fancy American toys. However, non-market solutions to a market-based problem are inevitably a recipe for disaster. Lets not shoot the messenger!

GMO Emerging Thoughts January 2005 Arjun Divecha that do not toe the Kremlin’s line and consider “serving the national interest” as part of their corporate charter may very well end up being renationalized. In short, either you go along with our program or we’ll do it for you. Finally, jailing Mr. Khodorkovsky is a clear warning to other oligarchs and business leaders that they should steer clear of politics and contemplate sublimating their political desires into ownership of sports franchises outside Russia. The San Francisco 49ers could certainly use a deep-pocketed owner. Yo! Potanin, over here! In short, Mr. Putin intends to have complete control of all levels of political and economic activity. It is telling that the only dissenting voice to speak up is that of his own maverick economic advisor Andrei Illarionov who said, “The sale of Yuganskneftegaz to a mystical, and now not so mystical, company named Baikal Finance Group has won this year’s ‘shady deal’ of the year award.” While Mr. Putin has ignored the free-speaking Illarionov’s inflammatory comments in the past, it will be interesting to see how he will react to this outburst. If Mr. Putin succeeds in creating this new paradigm of government sponsored capitalism (and I believe that in the short run, he very well might), my fear is that he will create a new model for development that will be detrimental to minority shareholders such as ourselves, not just in Russia, but elsewhere as well. So will he succeed? With high oil prices, a reduced foreign debt load, and massive foreign exchange reserves, there are no dark clouds on the horizon. While recent economic growth has been extremely dependent on high oil prices, we have started to see the beginnings of a consumer society that could fuel growth for the next few years. Looking at the history of other authoritarian regimes, one sees that they tend to succeed in their early phases – what I call the Bill Parcells1 effect – that intimidation does Eleven years ago, at GMO’s Annual Client Conference (soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union), I said I believed we were living in a golden age of capitalism. With communism and socialism having been so thoroughly and comprehensively discredited, there was only one competing paradigm for economic development – that of free and open markets and privatization of government owned companies, rather than nationalization and central planning. It was based on this shift that I made my long-term case for investing in emerging markets (although from a short-term point of view, October 1993 did not represent particularly good timing on my part). I also said that I did not believe that this golden age would last forever, that former socialists/authoritarians had not suddenly turned into committed free-traders, but were biding their time and would surely make a re- appearance some day, selling the same old vodka in new bottles. That day may now have arrived in Russia. In my opinion, Mr. Putin is trying to create a model of the modern authoritarian state where private corporations and government owned/controlled entities both serve some greater “national good” in addition to attempting to enrich their shareholders. The Yukos case serves as a multi-pronged attempt in attaining this goal. On one hand, it is perhaps the first step in reversing some of the privatizations of the early 90s and to establish a “national energy company” – a government controlled energy giant that would play in the same league as OPEC. While economic reasons play a role, the primary motivation is to serve Russia’s geopolitical goals. In a post 9/11 world of energy insecurity, Russia’s energy assets have more strategic clout than their nuclear missiles. Another aspect is to send a very clear signal to Mr. Khodorkovsky and his fellow oligarchs that companies The Empire Strikes Back 1 Bill Parcells, the current coach of the Dallas Cowboys, is famous for having taken a number of poor football teams under his control and making them successful. However, in my opinion, the secret to his success has been fear and intimidation, which works in the short run, but is ultimately counter-productive – as evidenced by his having to move to a new team every few years. 2 decisions about how we invest your money. As I said in my Emerging Thoughts piece on Mr. Putin’s early days in July 2000 (“Putin on the Ritz”), “As fund managers, we need to be able to distinguish the unpalatable from the unprofitable.” So, what are we doing about this situation? Our country selection process has four elements – three based on objective, quantitative data and one based on our judgment, which represents 10% of the overall assessment of a country. Currently, the quantitative parts of the model are quite negative on Russia, with a combined score of -0.9 (which is quite negative). While the market is relatively cheap (based on high oil company profits) our momentum and macroeconomic models are quite negative. This negative score translates into a moderately large underweighting relative to the benchmark. Given the risks I’ve talked about, it makes sense that we should have a negative judgment on Russia. If we were to assess a score of -1.0 on our judgment, the overall score for Russia would fall to -1.2 and our underweighting would increase by 1/2 a percent. Were the quantitative parts of the model to turn positive over the coming months, we would increase our weight in Russia, recognizing that our judgment serves as a drag on how much we buy, but does not override it. Would we override the entire process and get out of Russia altogether? Yes, in an extreme circumstance. However, these kinds of systemic overrides are few and far between. The last time we chose to get out a country altogether was when we sold all of our Pakistani holdings when the central bank stealthily imposed capital controls in 2001. While events in Russia are causing angst and forcing us to watch the situation very carefully, we are not yet close to having to take extreme measures. It’s time to be afraid, but not very afraid. work in the short run. Thus the next few years could see continued strong economic growth in Russia. However, authoritarian regimes tend to fail in the medium to longer term for a very simple reason – every petty official from the president on down acquires the ability to be capricious or corrupt without fear of consequences, and frequently chooses to use that power to further their own personal interests. We saw proof of this concept in late December when a senior official within the telecommunication ministry tried (but ultimately failed) to levy punitive back taxes on the cellular carrier Vimplecom. It turns out that this official is affiliated with a major shareholder of one of Vimplecom’s competitors. However, internal affairs within Russia are not the only cause for concern. Recent events in Ukraine also raise the prospect that Russia is on a collision course with the West over what it sees as encroachment onto its home turf. Having owned and backed the wrong candidate in the recent election, Mr. Putin may be behind by a couple of goals, but make no mistake, it’s only the first period in a game that has no ending. And, if the sordid history of Yukos is any guide, Mr. Putin is not a leader lightly scorned. Given that Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its natural gas (a number that will rise, not fall, in coming years) and that 80% of that gas transits through Ukraine, Russia holds a number of very significant cards in this game. One can see Mr. Putin using these cards to pull Ukraine back into the Russian fold – which will exacerbate tensions with the West. Finally, Russia has started to make overtures to China, India, and Iran – offering them a stake in future energy ventures along with advanced military weaponry, with the explicit goal of driving a wedge between them and the US. All these factors increase risks for Western minority investors in Russia. While this kind of speculation makes for good cocktail party chatter, we are in the position of having to make GMO Emerging Thoughts The Empire Strikes Back, January 2005

The Chechen war, for example, has been a costly and bloody affair for both sides, and the government has been reluctant to admit that it has made mistakes in its handling of the conflict. The war in Chechnya has also highlighted the fragility of the Russian state and the challenges it faces in maintaining control over its vast and diverse territory.

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The text you've referenced appears to be an excerpt from a personal or professional goal-setting document for the year 2012, authored by someone named Arjun. The key phrase mentioned is "Overall, most of what I hope to achieve in 2012 is a continuation o..." which is cut off, but it suggests the author is focusing on building on previous efforts rather than starting entirely new initiatives.

Since the full text is not available, I'll provide a general analysis of what such investment insights might entail, based on the context and common goal-setting practices in 2012. Here's a detailed analysis of potential investment insights and perspectives:

### 1. **Continuity and Long-Term Strategy**
The phrase "continuation" implies that the author is likely focusing on long-term strategies rather than short-term gains. In 2012, the global economy was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, and many investors were cautious. A continuation approach might involve:
- **Maintaining existing investment positions** that have shown resilience or growth.
- **Rebalancing portfolios** to ensure alignment with long-term goals, especially in light of market volatility.
- **Avoiding impulsive decisions** driven by short-term market fluctuations.

### 2. **Risk Management and Diversification**
Given the economic climate in 2012, risk management would have been a key concern. The author might have emphasized:
- **Diversifying

What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Arjun 2012 Goals
Looking Forward
Overall, most of what I hope to achieve in 2012 is a continuation or improvement of my performance from 2011. In 2011, I had an overall positive return, but there were several areas where I could have improved. In 2012, I hope to make progress in each of these areas. With that in mind, let me list the goals I have for 2012 (and beyond). The first goal, which I mentioned in my year in review, is to reach the point where I can consistently and confidently make decisions in emerging markets. In 2011, I had a few scores of positive returns in emerging markets, but there were just as many large losers. I’m not making progress in this area if I don’t reduce the number of large losers. In general, I want to focus more on opportunities that I can understand and control, especially in the U.S. market. The second goal is to increase the number of trades I make in the U.S. market. Even though I have had some success here, I have not been consistent enough to make this a major part of my portfolio. The next goal is to improve my ability to read company management and to assess management quality. In 2011, I had one trade

EXPECTED ANSWER:

Shooting the Messenger?
On July 2, the 100-year badla system will give away to a T+ 5 compulsory rolling settlement system. While this change is ostensibly geared to creating a more transparent system, the timing of the move reflects paranoia on the part of the authorities and will only exacerbate the bear market. The main casualty has been and will continue to be liquidity!
A liquid stock market enables capital to get allocated quickly and efficiently, benefiting investors, companies and governments.  Today, investors pay significant premiums for liquidity in all equity markets. In an increasingly competitive world for investment dollars, one of the few advantages Indian markets had was liquidity and depth.  Unlike other emerging markets where only a handful of stocks are liquid, India boasted tens of stocks that traded over $100 million a day each; greatly increasing it’s attractiveness to large investors. 
Why does liquidity matter? There are several companies in emerging markets that are more profitable, but more undervalued on any metric when compared to Indian companies. Take an example of Thai Union Frozen - it’s the equivalent of Infosys in the global shrimp business with revenues of $800 million (twice that of Infosys) and profits of $50 million. It has a return on equity of 20% and earnings growth of 15-20% annually. Yet it has a market value of less than $300 million as compared to $8 billion for Infosys. Why is so undervalued? The shrimp business is certainly less sexy than software, but at the end of the day they are both cyclical commodity businesses. The main reason for the difference in value is liquidity as it trades a measly $50,000 to $100,000 a day versus $200 -300 million for Infosys. While it is easy to dismiss Thailand today, lets not forget that in 1994 the market traded over $1 billion a day (when India traded $20-30 million a day).
Implicit in today’s Indian market multiples is a premium for liquidity. As liquidity reduces, it can easily set up a vicious circle leading to valuations for software leaders to drop to 10 to 15 times (or less) earnings. We have already seen this happen with the second and third tier software companies. This effectively increases the cost of capital impacting their global competitiveness. The dream that software exports will reach $80 billion by 2008 will remain just that.
It's easy to want to find scapegoats for a vicious bear market. Bursting the global tech bubble of 1998-2000 caused pain everywhere, not just in India. The high liquidity associated with this bubble may now appear speculative and harmful but lets not forget the benefits that India enjoyed from it. Liquidity enabled a lot of companies to raise cheap capital and improve balance sheets. Today, in the technology downturn this capital will help them survive. The boom in stock prices created unprecedented media publicity for the Indian software story. It resulted in India being on the investment horizon of a lot of institutions that earlier avoided it. 
To Indian regulators, futures and options may seem to be the panacea to cure the evils of badla (of which there are undoubtedly many). However, they have not been successful in any emerging market we know of. The biggest investors in most emerging markets are foreign and domestic mutual funds - they are severely constrained in the use of such derivative instruments. In nascent capital markets, small domestic investors don’t really understand the intricacies of such instruments and end up being losers. Who then will use these derivatives? Ketan Parikh?
SEBI has recently released the list of companies which will have options traded.  Some companies that were trading more than $300 million a day have been excluded, presumably on the ground that they were speculative favourites. Lets not forget that speculation and investment are two sides of the same coin. It's impossible to have one without the other. It should not be the role of the market regulator to decide which stocks should have options (and therefore affect capital allocation) - let the market decide that. If there are then abuses of market manipulation, they should use the existing laws on the books to deal with them.
It’s easy to dismiss successful homegrown systems and go in for fancy American toys. However, non-market solutions to a market-based problem are inevitably a recipe for disaster. Lets not shoot the messenger!
