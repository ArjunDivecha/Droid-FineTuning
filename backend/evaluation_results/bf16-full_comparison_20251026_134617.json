      "base_response": "Financial repression refers to the practice of imposing high interest rates on financial institutions and businesses to discourage investment and consumption. This can have a significant impact on savings in emerging markets, as it can lead to a decrease in the availability of credit and a reduction in the amount of money available for savings.\n\nIn emerging markets, where the economy is often characterized by high levels of debt and low savings rates, financial repression can exacerbate these issues. As interest rates rise, it becomes more difficult for businesses and individuals to borrow money, which can lead to a decrease in investment and consumption. This can result in a decline in the overall level of economic activity and a reduction in the amount of money available for savings.\n\nFurthermore, financial repression can also lead to a decrease in the availability of credit, which can make it more difficult for individuals and businesses to access the financial resources they need to save and invest. This can further exacerbate the issue of low savings rates and a lack of financial stability in emerging markets.\n\nOverall, financial repression can have a significant impact on savings in emerging markets, as it can lead to a decrease in the availability of credit and a reduction in the amount of money available for savings.

      "adapter_response": "By what mechanism is this achieved? In what situation does this mechanism fail?\nSavings in emerging markets have historically been low (relative to other emerging countries). Why is savings low? There are several factors, most of which are related to macroeconomics and policy. This article focuses on one factor that has been largely overlooked in the developed world: financial repression.\nRepression of currency exchange rates causes businesses to earn low margins by exporting to developed countries. It also causes countries to pay high foreign exchange rates. Both of these factors lead to capital outflows, which otherwise would contribute to economic growth.\nLet's look at an example. Consider the situation in India in the 1990s, a time when foreign direct and portfolio investment accounted for 30% of total savings, compared to 10% for foreign exors in the developed world. At the same time, foreign exchange earnings of India were at about -0.5% of national savings (in U.S. dollars), one of the highest of any emerging market (and relative to the developed world as a whole). If you added all foreign direct and portfolio investment (about 20% of total savings) you came close to matching the level of foreign exors in India (1993, 1999).\nLook at the situation in India today. Foreign direct and portfolio investment accounts for 12% of total savings, compared to 19% in the U.S. And the",

Are we now at the peak of economic growth in India?\nThese are the questions that Dr. Subhash Chandra, an economist at the National Economic Committee (RENCE), is trying to answer. He and his colleagues at REDC have been tracking India's economic growth for longer periods than other countries, and they have come to the conclusion that India's growth trajectory has been that of a \"dumb arrow\", shooting glissatas into the ground.\nOn the other hand, India has one of the largest and most sustainable people capitalizations in the world. This enables it to produce growth that is not only sustainable, but can contribute to the creation of a \"global India\" where wealth is not only created within India, but also enjoyed by people far and wide.\nThis is a crucial question that needs to be answered. If the economic growth shot into the ground last year was not due to \"globalisation\" and \"fundamentals\", then the question is more complex. Will the economic growth factors that contribute to a \"global India\" continue to drive growth, or will they have to look elsewhere for sustenance?\nOut of the many possible answers, India most closely resembles a \"firmwide crisis\" such as that in 1998/",

Overcapacity occurs when a company is producing more than it needs to, which can lead to higher costs and lower profits. This can result in a decrease in ROIC, as the company is not generating enough revenue to cover its costs and invest in new projects.\nOvercapacity can also lead to higher costs for the company, as it may need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure to meet the increased demand for its products or services. This can also lead to higher costs for the company's employees, as they may need to work longer hours or be paid higher wages to meet the increased demand for their services.\nOverall, overcapacity can have a negative impact on a company's ROIC, as it can lead to higher costs and lower profits.

Let\u2019s look at how the Indian market has done since February 2018 when liquidity was at it\u2019s peak. India\u2019s market multiples were at 2.7x (for the S&P/IFC Composite Index) while the market capitalization had reached $800 billion (as per IFC data). \nNow, let\u2019s look at what could happen if liquidity reduction continues. India\u2019s market capitalization would likely drop to $300 billion, while the market multiple would likely drop to 2.3x. In black swan parlance, this is like the market having a neck shot and not being able to recover. In this situation, most of the liquidity would have to go away and markets would have to choose a new metric to measure liquidity.  Let\u2019s look at the options available to markets to choose a new metric. One option would be to use market capitalization growth instead of market capitalization to measure liquidity. Market capitalization growth would measure liquidity by how well it measures the quality of the capitalization i.e. how well it measures the size of the company). Another option",
