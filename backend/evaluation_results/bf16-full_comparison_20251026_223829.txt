EXPECTED ANSWER:
Shooting the Messenger?
On July 2, the 100-year badla system will give away to a T+ 5 compulsory rolling settlement system. While this change is ostensibly geared to creating a more transparent system, the timing of the move reflects paranoia on the part of the authorities and will only exacerbate the bear market. The main casualty has been and will continue to be liquidity!
A liquid stock market enables capital to get allocated quickly and efficiently, benefiting investors, companies and governments.  Today, investors pay significant premiums for liquidity in all equity markets. In an increasingly competitive world for investment dollars, one of the few advantages Indian markets had was liquidity and depth.  Unlike other emerging markets where only a handful of stocks are liquid, India boasted tens of stocks that traded over $100 million a day each; greatly increasing it’s attractiveness to large investors. 
Why does liquidity matter? There are several companies in emerging markets that are more profitable, but more undervalued on any metric when compared to Indian companies. Take an example of Thai Union Frozen - it’s the equivalent of Infosys in the global shrimp business with revenues of $800 million (twice that of Infosys) and profits of $50 million. It has a return on equity of 20% and earnings growth of 15-20% annually. Yet it has a market value of less than $300 million as compared to $8 billion for Infosys. Why is so undervalued? The shrimp business is certainly less sexy than software, but at the end of the day they are both cyclical commodity businesses. The main reason for the difference in value is liquidity as it trades a measly $50,000 to $100,000 a day versus $200 -300 million for Infosys. While it is easy to dismiss Thailand today, lets not forget that in 1994 the market traded over $1 billion a day (when India traded $20-30 million a day).
Implicit in today’s Indian market multiples is a premium for liquidity. As liquidity reduces, it can easily set up a vicious circle leading to valuations for software leaders to drop to 10 to 15 times (or less) earnings. We have already seen this happen with the second and third tier software companies. This effectively increases the cost of capital impacting their global competitiveness. The dream that software exports will reach $80 billion by 2008 will remain just that.
It's easy to want to find scapegoats for a vicious bear market. Bursting the global tech bubble of 1998-2000 caused pain everywhere, not just in India. The high liquidity associated with this bubble may now appear speculative and harmful but lets not forget the benefits that India enjoyed from it. Liquidity enabled a lot of companies to raise cheap capital and improve balance sheets. Today, in the technology downturn this capital will help them survive. The boom in stock prices created unprecedented media publicity for the Indian software story. It resulted in India being on the investment horizon of a lot of institutions that earlier avoided it. 
To Indian regulators, futures and options may seem to be the panacea to cure the evils of badla (of which there are undoubtedly many). However, they have not been successful in any emerging market we know of. The biggest investors in most emerging markets are foreign and domestic mutual funds - they are severely constrained in the use of such derivative instruments. In nascent capital markets, small domestic investors don’t really understand the intricacies of such instruments and end up being losers. Who then will use these derivatives? Ketan Parikh?
SEBI has recently released the list of companies which will have options traded.  Some companies that were trading more than $300 million a day have been excluded, presumably on the ground that they were speculative favourites. Lets not forget that speculation and investment are two sides of the same coin. It's impossible to have one without the other. It should not be the role of the market regulator to decide which stocks should have options (and therefore affect capital allocation) - let the market decide that. If there are then abuses of market manipulation, they should use the existing laws on the books to deal with them.
It’s easy to dismiss successful homegrown systems and go in for fancy American toys. However, non-market solutions to a market-based problem are inevitably a recipe for disaster. Lets not shoot the messenger!

EXPECTED ANSWER:
An Unfinished Tale of Two Bubbles
What’s the common theme linking Cisco and Nvidia? 
They’re both equipment suppliers to a new technology that’s going to change the world. And right now, like in 1998, everybody with half a brain can see that these new technologies are going to be huge. But, unfortunately, there are very few ways to play that glorious future that’s in the near future.
We all know the story of Levi Strauss & Co. during the California Gold Rush – the equipment suppliers that made money in that bubble.
And so we see Cisco and Nvidia today in a similar vein. 
But once the technology starts to be used to actually change the world, other companies are major beneficiaries (like Amazon, Google etc.) and the equipment suppliers are correctly seen as commodity producers with low margins as competition seeps in.
And so it is today. Here’s a chart of Cisco vs Nvidia starting 18 months before the top of the tech bubble on a similar time and return scale.
Are we now at the top for Nvidia? That’s unknowable.
As my colleague Jeremey Grantham likes to say, trying to figure out the top of a bubble is like charting the path of a feather in a hurricane. You have no idea as to how far or how high it will go. There is only one thing you know with certainty. It will hit the ground.
And so it was with Cisco… 
If you bought it at the top - almost 25 years later, you’re still losing money.
So will Nvidia follow suit? Inevitably.
What I predict is that sometime in the next 12 months, we will see the peak. And you’re a fool if you think you can time that event exactly.
My advice is to sell 1/12th of your Nvidia holding now and another 1/12th every month for the next 12 months irrespective of what the stock does. That way, if I’m right that the top will be in the next 12 months, you will have got out near the top. And save yourself a bunch of sleepless nights.

QUESTION 4:

EXPECTED ANSWER:
GMO North America | Europe | Australasia Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 “Dude, Where’s My Alpha?” Arjun Divecha Over the last 4 years we’ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term. We examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we’re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it. Country Selection – How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries? Chart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid 1998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative underperformance over the next 12 months. What this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen. Chart 1: How Cheap Are Cheap Countries? Cheap Countries Are Relatively Expensive 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Value of Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries Narrow Spread Wide Spread Normally Trade at a 22% Discount Current Discount: 15% Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 2 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia What Are We Doing About It? It’s important to note that while value is an important part of our country selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, Macroeconomics and Judgment form 55% of our country selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver outperformance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion. We normally run our country selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets. Stock Picking Within Country – How Cheap Are Value and Small Cap Stocks? Looking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap “value” stocks have been over time, relative to the index. What this chart shows is that value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount, the narrowest we’ve seen in the 15-year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively outperformed. In the last few months we have seen a similar contraction in the positioning of value in the U.S. and developed markets, but not to uncharted waters, which is where we are now in Emerging. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it’s still at a 34% discount)? Chart 2: How Cheap Are Value Stocks? Value Stocks are Relatively Expensive 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Value of Cheap Stocks Relative to Benchmark October 2000: 46% Discount Current: 34% Discount Narrow Spread Wide Spread Normally Trade at 40% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 3 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia We have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure – it’s unlikely to be a good thing. So, if value isn’t attractive, what is? Let’s first look at small cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they’re not as cheap as they usually are either. That’s exactly what Chart 3 shows – the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance. What Are We Doing About It? The question we ask ourselves is, “If value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?” We first looked at “growth” stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive. Another group of stocks we follow quite closely is high quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today. Chart 3: How Cheap Are Small Stocks? Small Stocks Are Fairly Valued 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 1.05 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 October 2000: 32% Discount Current: 12% Discount Normally Trade at 16% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 4 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia GMO’s experience suggests that markets systematically underprice quality. In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low-debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today. Over the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current “Value” model for stock picking with a new “Quality-Adjusted-Value” model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004. Chart 5: Quality Is Relatively Cheap 0.85 0.95 1.05 1.15 1.25 1.35 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Currently: 0% Premium Normally Trade at 9% Premium to Market Jan- Source: GMO Chart 4: How Attractive Are Growth* Stocks? 0.52 0.72 0.92 1.12 1.32 1.52 1.72 1.92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Jan- * Non-loss making companies that are forecast to have the highest 2 year growth Source: GMO Currently: 31% Premium Normally Trade at 23% Premium to Market Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 5 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia In the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider “junky” value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new “Quality-Adjusted-Value” model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts. Finally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that’s precisely why we use both strategies – to diversify each other). Overall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we’ll sleep much easier. What Should You Do About This? So, when you hear from us that our ability to add value is diminished, what’s the appropriate response? When we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset allocation group’s 7-year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset allocation products. Another response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs. Those of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar year end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index1, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way. We’re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don’t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride. 1 The S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index is an independently maintained and published emerging market stock index.

EXPECTED ANSWER:
GMO Emerging Thoughts January 2005 Arjun Divecha that do not toe the Kremlin’s line and consider “serving the national interest” as part of their corporate charter may very well end up being renationalized. In short, either you go along with our program or we’ll do it for you. Finally, jailing Mr. Khodorkovsky is a clear warning to other oligarchs and business leaders that they should steer clear of politics and contemplate sublimating their political desires into ownership of sports franchises outside Russia. The San Francisco 49ers could certainly use a deep-pocketed owner. Yo! Potanin, over here! In short, Mr. Putin intends to have complete control of all levels of political and economic activity. It is telling that the only dissenting voice to speak up is that of his own maverick economic advisor Andrei Illarionov who said, “The sale of Yuganskneftegaz to a mystical, and now not so mystical, company named Baikal Finance Group has won this year’s ‘shady deal’ of the year award.” While Mr. Putin has ignored the free-speaking Illarionov’s inflammatory comments in the past, it will be interesting to see how he will react to this outburst. If Mr. Putin succeeds in creating this new paradigm of government sponsored capitalism (and I believe that in the short run, he very well might), my fear is that he will create a new model for development that will be detrimental to minority shareholders such as ourselves, not just in Russia, but elsewhere as well. So will he succeed? With high oil prices, a reduced foreign debt load, and massive foreign exchange reserves, there are no dark clouds on the horizon. While recent economic growth has been extremely dependent on high oil prices, we have started to see the beginnings of a consumer society that could fuel growth for the next few years. Looking at the history of other authoritarian regimes, one sees that they tend to succeed in their early phases – what I call the Bill Parcells1 effect – that intimidation does Eleven years ago, at GMO’s Annual Client Conference (soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union), I said I believed we were living in a golden age of capitalism. With communism and socialism having been so thoroughly and comprehensively discredited, there was only one competing paradigm for economic development – that of free and open markets and privatization of government owned companies, rather than nationalization and central planning. It was based on this shift that I made my long-term case for investing in emerging markets (although from a short-term point of view, October 1993 did not represent particularly good timing on my part). I also said that I did not believe that this golden age would last forever, that former socialists/authoritarians had not suddenly turned into committed free-traders, but were biding their time and would surely make a re- appearance some day, selling the same old vodka in new bottles. That day may now have arrived in Russia. In my opinion, Mr. Putin is trying to create a model of the modern authoritarian state where private corporations and government owned/controlled entities both serve some greater “national good” in addition to attempting to enrich their shareholders. The Yukos case serves as a multi-pronged attempt in attaining this goal. On one hand, it is perhaps the first step in reversing some of the privatizations of the early 90s and to establish a “national energy company” – a government controlled energy giant that would play in the same league as OPEC. While economic reasons play a role, the primary motivation is to serve Russia’s geopolitical goals. In a post 9/11 world of energy insecurity, Russia’s energy assets have more strategic clout than their nuclear missiles. Another aspect is to send a very clear signal to Mr. Khodorkovsky and his fellow oligarchs that companies The Empire Strikes Back 1 Bill Parcells, the current coach of the Dallas Cowboys, is famous for having taken a number of poor football teams under his control and making them successful. However, in my opinion, the secret to his success has been fear and intimidation, which works in the short run, but is ultimately counter-productive – as evidenced by his having to move to a new team every few years. 2 decisions about how we invest your money. As I said in my Emerging Thoughts piece on Mr. Putin’s early days in July 2000 (“Putin on the Ritz”), “As fund managers, we need to be able to distinguish the unpalatable from the unprofitable.” So, what are we doing about this situation? Our country selection process has four elements – three based on objective, quantitative data and one based on our judgment, which represents 10% of the overall assessment of a country. Currently, the quantitative parts of the model are quite negative on Russia, with a combined score of -0.9 (which is quite negative). While the market is relatively cheap (based on high oil company profits) our momentum and macroeconomic models are quite negative. This negative score translates into a moderately large underweighting relative to the benchmark. Given the risks I’ve talked about, it makes sense that we should have a negative judgment on Russia. If we were to assess a score of -1.0 on our judgment, the overall score for Russia would fall to -1.2 and our underweighting would increase by 1/2 a percent. Were the quantitative parts of the model to turn positive over the coming months, we would increase our weight in Russia, recognizing that our judgment serves as a drag on how much we buy, but does not override it. Would we override the entire process and get out of Russia altogether? Yes, in an extreme circumstance. However, these kinds of systemic overrides are few and far between. The last time we chose to get out a country altogether was when we sold all of our Pakistani holdings when the central bank stealthily imposed capital controls in 2001. While events in Russia are causing angst and forcing us to watch the situation very carefully, we are not yet close to having to take extreme measures. It’s time to be afraid, but not very afraid. work in the short run. Thus the next few years could see continued strong economic growth in Russia. However, authoritarian regimes tend to fail in the medium to longer term for a very simple reason – every petty official from the president on down acquires the ability to be capricious or corrupt without fear of consequences, and frequently chooses to use that power to further their own personal interests. We saw proof of this concept in late December when a senior official within the telecommunication ministry tried (but ultimately failed) to levy punitive back taxes on the cellular carrier Vimplecom. It turns out that this official is affiliated with a major shareholder of one of Vimplecom’s competitors. However, internal affairs within Russia are not the only cause for concern. Recent events in Ukraine also raise the prospect that Russia is on a collision course with the West over what it sees as encroachment onto its home turf. Having owned and backed the wrong candidate in the recent election, Mr. Putin may be behind by a couple of goals, but make no mistake, it’s only the first period in a game that has no ending. And, if the sordid history of Yukos is any guide, Mr. Putin is not a leader lightly scorned. Given that Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its natural gas (a number that will rise, not fall, in coming years) and that 80% of that gas transits through Ukraine, Russia holds a number of very significant cards in this game. One can see Mr. Putin using these cards to pull Ukraine back into the Russian fold – which will exacerbate tensions with the West. Finally, Russia has started to make overtures to China, India, and Iran – offering them a stake in future energy ventures along with advanced military weaponry, with the explicit goal of driving a wedge between them and the US. All these factors increase risks for Western minority investors in Russia. While this kind of speculation makes for good cocktail party chatter, we are in the position of having to make GMO Emerging Thoughts The Empire Strikes Back, January 2005

The concept presented here is the idea that GMOs (genetically modified organisms) should not be used in agriculture, as they pose a significant risk to human health and the environment. The author argues that the use of GMOs is not in line with the Kremlin's stance, which is to promote the use of genetically modified crops to increase food production and reduce the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers. The author suggests that the use of GMOs is a violation of the principles of sustainable agriculture and the environment, and that it is not in the best interest of human health and the environment to use GMOs in agriculture.

The author's argument is supported by the fact that GMOs have been shown to have negative health effects on humans, such as increased risk of allergies, cancer, and other health problems. Additionally, GMOs have been shown to have negative environmental effects, such as increased use of pesticides and fertilizers, which can harm the environment and the health of non-target species. The author also suggests that the use of GMOs is not in the best interest of human health and the environment, as it is not in line with the principles of sustainable agriculture and the environment.

Indeed, he has been invited to speak at length about his views and experiences. The case for Sergey Ilyin and other GDM participants is particularly strong given that he is the one that is most able to put complex economic ideas in the Kremlin’s mouth. While this view may be persuasive from a distance, one must not forget that Mr. Ilyin is also the representative of the richest and most powerful company in the world – GDM – and that he has been actively involved with the Kremlin since the very beginning. It thus puts him in a unique position to make even-handed comments about current events and to represent the interests of the most powerful people in the world. It should not be assumed that because a senior official of the government wields significant social and practical influence that he or she therefore has the final say on matters of national interest.

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Thoughts: 
Buying small cap stocks in emerging markets is the best way to access burgeoning domestic demand: 
e believe that one of the most compelling investment  opportunities over the next few years is likely to be in companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets  (see the recent GMO White Paper entitled “What Happens In Emerging, Stays in Emerging”). 
As this domestic demand play gains momentum, we increasingly hear that the best way to capture this theme is through buying small cap stocks in emerging markets. We believe this is a mistake.  In this paper, we make the case that small caps are NOT a good proxy for domestic demand and that focusing on companies that specifically serve domestic demand is a more effective means to exploit the opportunity.  Besides, why buy a proxy when you can buy the real thing?
First let’s look at  argument.   Favoring small cap  on the presumption that large caps in emerging markets are mainly focused on export and globally oriented businesses. As a result, removing these large cap names from the investable universe will leave a universe of companies that are largely focused on domestic demand. The first part of this contention is true, the second is not. Large caps are highly geared to global demand. However, the small cap universe alone does not represent a pure play on domestic demand
Figure 1 shows the sector weights of Small Cap and Broad Emerging universes*, separated into sectors that are domestically oriented (Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Telecoms and Utilities) and those that are globally sensitive (Energy, Materials, Technology and most Industrials). As the chart clearly shows, globally sensitive sectors are almost as highly represented in aggregate in the small cap universe as in the broad universe. In fact globally sensitive sectors represent45% of the small cap universe vs. 47% for the broad universe as of Sept 2011. 
Instead of using a simplistic approach to accessing domestic demand opportunities by using small caps as a proxy, what if we were to build a universe of companies that serve domestic demand, based on who their ultimate customer is, rather than market capitalization? This universe would eliminate all companies that primarily serve global demand, determined on a company by company basis by looking at their financial statements investigative work and strong fundamental analysis.  
Figure 2 shows sector weights of this true domestic demand universe alongside that of the small cap universe. We see that the domestic universe has a far lower exposure to globally sensitive sectors than the small cap universe. In fact, even the companies represented within globally sensitive sectors of the domestic universe are those that specifically serve domestic demand such as technology companies whose business is primarily within emerging markets rather than those that export to developed countries. An example of this would be Kingdee International, which provides Chinese language ERP software and services and competes with the likes of SAP for small and medium size businesses in China. 
.
Last, but not least, not all domestic demand in emerging is served by companies domiciled within emerging markets. Global multinationals also serve this rising demand and in some cases, are dominant players. A complete universe focusing on domestic demand should include these multinationals, especially ones that receive a substantial part of their earnings/revenues from  emerging markets. These multinationals will never be part of the emerging market small cap universe, and while they represent a small part of the domestic demand universe at the current time, we should expect them to become a larger part of the domestic demand opportunity as their earnings and revenues from emerging markets continue to grow. Examples range from relatively new entrants like Yum Brands (which owns and operates the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchises) to Unilever (which set up a local subsidiary in India in 1931 and has been listed on the Indian stock market since 1956). 
To conclude, the best way to access demand from burgeoning middle class in the emerging markets is to invest in companies that directly serve that demand, rather than using emerging markets small caps as a proxy. 
 In short, 
* The broad universe includes all companies represented in union of the S&P/IFC EM Investable Universe and the MSCI EM Universe weighted by investable capitalization – about 3,500 companies. The Small Cap universe represents the bottom 25% of the broad universe by market capitalization, about 2,700 companies.

At the same time, we must not forget that large caps in emerging markets are almost as cheap as small caps in the global market. Thus, for some companies, an appropriate entry point may well be the small cap market. 
In short, we believe that small caps are most valuable in a situation where large caps are not.

QUESTION 10:
Write an investment analysis on the topic discussed in this excerpt: Why we got Russia wrong In 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the ...

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Why we got Russia wrong In 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF). I have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, “The four most dangerous words in the English language are – This Time it’s Different”. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that’s why we got it wrong. We manage EMF with a focus on the top down – our view is (and has been for the entire 28 years period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60-70% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors. We do this in a primarily quantitative fashion – using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions – value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important. In addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance. This strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies. With that as background, let’s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis. Russia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum [BINU FIX THIS]. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation. So then the question became – in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether? Alas, we did not. What was our thinking behind this? We believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all out assault on the entire country, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes. But even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about-face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well. The issues in our minds are – what could/should have we done differently? First of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex-ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Lets assume that I’m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be to protect against black swan events, ie how much tail risk insurance should you buy? The answer I come to is the same I did prior to this – very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions. The next question is did we right size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide – our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not lead to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8-9%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years. In summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin’s eyes… China / Taiwan bekons…

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Shooting the Messenger?
On July 2, the 100-year badla system will give away to a T+ 5 compulsory rolling settlement system. While this change is ostensibly geared to creating a more transparent system, the timing of the move reflects paranoia on the part of the authorities and will only exacerbate the bear market. The main casualty has been and will continue to be liquidity!
A liquid stock market enables capital to get allocated quickly and efficiently, benefiting investors, companies and governments.  Today, investors pay significant premiums for liquidity in all equity markets. In an increasingly competitive world for investment dollars, one of the few advantages Indian markets had was liquidity and depth.  Unlike other emerging markets where only a handful of stocks are liquid, India boasted tens of stocks that traded over $100 million a day each; greatly increasing it’s attractiveness to large investors. 
Why does liquidity matter? There are several companies in emerging markets that are more profitable, but more undervalued on any metric when compared to Indian companies. Take an example of Thai Union Frozen - it’s the equivalent of Infosys in the global shrimp business with revenues of $800 million (twice that of Infosys) and profits of $50 million. It has a return on equity of 20% and earnings growth of 15-20% annually. Yet it has a market value of less than $300 million as compared to $8 billion for Infosys. Why is so undervalued? The shrimp business is certainly less sexy than software, but at the end of the day they are both cyclical commodity businesses. The main reason for the difference in value is liquidity as it trades a measly $50,000 to $100,000 a day versus $200 -300 million for Infosys. While it is easy to dismiss Thailand today, lets not forget that in 1994 the market traded over $1 billion a day (when India traded $20-30 million a day).
Implicit in today’s Indian market multiples is a premium for liquidity. As liquidity reduces, it can easily set up a vicious circle leading to valuations for software leaders to drop to 10 to 15 times (or less) earnings. We have already seen this happen with the second and third tier software companies. This effectively increases the cost of capital impacting their global competitiveness. The dream that software exports will reach $80 billion by 2008 will remain just that.
It's easy to want to find scapegoats for a vicious bear market. Bursting the global tech bubble of 1998-2000 caused pain everywhere, not just in India. The high liquidity associated with this bubble may now appear speculative and harmful but lets not forget the benefits that India enjoyed from it. Liquidity enabled a lot of companies to raise cheap capital and improve balance sheets. Today, in the technology downturn this capital will help them survive. The boom in stock prices created unprecedented media publicity for the Indian software story. It resulted in India being on the investment horizon of a lot of institutions that earlier avoided it. 
To Indian regulators, futures and options may seem to be the panacea to cure the evils of badla (of which there are undoubtedly many). However, they have not been successful in any emerging market we know of. The biggest investors in most emerging markets are foreign and domestic mutual funds - they are severely constrained in the use of such derivative instruments. In nascent capital markets, small domestic investors don’t really understand the intricacies of such instruments and end up being losers. Who then will use these derivatives? Ketan Parikh?
SEBI has recently released the list of companies which will have options traded.  Some companies that were trading more than $300 million a day have been excluded, presumably on the ground that they were speculative favourites. Lets not forget that speculation and investment are two sides of the same coin. It's impossible to have one without the other. It should not be the role of the market regulator to decide which stocks should have options (and therefore affect capital allocation) - let the market decide that. If there are then abuses of market manipulation, they should use the existing laws on the books to deal with them.
It’s easy to dismiss successful homegrown systems and go in for fancy American toys. However, non-market solutions to a market-based problem are inevitably a recipe for disaster. Lets not shoot the messenger!

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The shooting of the Messenger is a controversial topic that has been debated for years. The idea of using a T+5 compulsory rollover to give away to a T+100-year badla system is a complex and controversial one. Let's analyze this investment analysis:

1. The T+5 rollover: The T+5 rollover is a system that allows investors to roll over their investments to a T+100-year badla system. This system is designed to provide investors with a way to lock in their investments for a longer period of time, potentially increasing their returns over the long term.

2. The T+100-year badla system: The T+100-year badla system is a system that provides investors with a way to lock in their investments for a long period of time, potentially increasing their returns over the long term. This system is designed to provide investors with a way to lock in their investments for a long period of time, potentially increasing their returns over the long term.

3. The T+5 rollover and T+100-year badla system: The T+5 rollover and T+100-year badla system are two different investment options that have different benefits and risks. The T+5 rollover allows investors to roll over their investments to a T+100-year badla system, while the T+100-year badla system provides investors with a way to lock in their

EXPECTED ANSWER:
GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, Stays in Emerging Arjun Divecha The Opportunity We have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets. In the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4 trillion and daily trading volume of around $40 billion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets. While there are many ways to segment emerging markets – by region, big cap vs. small cap, value vs. growth – we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure. In recent years, there has been much talk about the coupling/decoupling of emerging markets vis-à-vis the developed world. We fi nd this either/or characterization misses the mark when, in fact, the reality is far more complicated. Perhaps a better way to think about growth in emerging markets is to characterize it as having two components: correlated growth, which is driven by links with the developed world, and uncorrelated growth, which depends more on the internal dynamics and demographics of the emerging markets themselves. From this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalized world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a “seven lean years” scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a “pure play” on the economic growth of these countries. The Case for Domestic Demand Looking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors. In addition, because they compete globally, margins are likely to be squeezed by having to go toe-to-toe with well-capitalized global competitors. 2 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Global commodity producers may continue to do well (as they have over the previous decade) if commodity prices stay high or rise even further. For most institutional investors, it makes sense to have an overall commodity strategy with commodity producers from emerging markets in the mix. However, we do not believe that they represent an emerging “pure play” as they are driven by global rather than purely emerging market forces. The main case for the domestic demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confl uence of two forces: economics and demographics. The Economic Case The economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging market countries arriving at the “sweet spot,” where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries begin to get richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. For example, we have seen savings rates in emerging markets rise from 13% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35% today (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1 Savings Rates Have Risen with Income in Emerging Markets However, once per capita GDP levels reach the range of $3,000 to $10,000, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. We believe that this occurs for two reasons. First, at these levels of national wealth, societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets. Second, individuals have newfound discretionary income, which they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this “sweet spot” of $3,000 to $10,000 per capita GDP and then drop. Exhibit 2 shows this pattern in a number of developed markets as they became richer. In recent years, we have seen the same pattern repeated in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, Israel, etc. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Savings Rate Mean Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 3 Exhibit 2 However, Savings Rates Drop Dramatically When GDP/Capita Reaches the $3,000-$10,000 Range We've Seen This in Developed Markets at a Similar Stage of Development Korea Savings Rate vs. Per Capita GDP 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Portugal 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Japan -20 0 20 40 60 80 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Greece 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Australia 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 $0 $5,000 $10,000 $15,000 $20,000 $25,000 Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO 4 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 What makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50% of emerging market countries (by market cap) are in this sweet spot (Exhibit 3). This was not the case 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago. Thus, if economic growth remains strong in emerging markets, one can reasonably expect to see large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending. Exhibit 3 50% of Emerging Countries Are Now in the Sweet Spot of Shifting from Savings to Consumption While a number of sell-side analysts suggest that this story is already well-known and priced into markets, we beg to differ. We believe when incomes reach this sweet spot, the elasticity of demand becomes highly non-linear, where small increases in per capita income lead to large increases in consumption. A simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In the year 2000, Chinese crossed $1,000 per capita GDP. In that year, auto sales fi rst exceeded 1 million vehicles. Ten years later, Chinese GDP more than quadrupled, to $4,400 per capita. What happened to auto sales? Did they go from 1 million to 4 million? No. They went from 1 million to 17 million! No analyst that we know of predicted anything close to these numbers. It’s very diffi cult to forecast this kind of growth, so high growth forecasts tend to be 20% to 30% at each point in time, followed by upward revisions on a regular basis. As a result of these factors, we are reasonably confi dent that per capita consumption in emerging market countries will rise substantially in the next few years and that much of this consumption growth is not anticipated by markets. The Demographic Shift What makes an already good story potentially explosive is the fact that demographics are not static and indicate that the number of people in their prime working (and consuming) years will also rise dramatically in the next few years (both in absolute terms and relative to the developed markets). Exhibit 4 shows the dependency ratio, which is defi ned as the ratio of non-working-age to working-age people in both the emerging and developed markets. As the downward sloping line shows, demographics in emerging markets have improved dramatically over the last few years (with the dependency ratio falling) and they will remain in this sweet spot for the next few decades. What this means is that the number of people that are working relative to those not working has dramatically improved and will remain there for the next 20 to 30 years. (Obviously, this is not true for all emerging market countries. Eastern Europe’s and China’s dependency ratios deteriorate quite rapidly over the next 25 years, while those of India, Indonesia, and Turkey improve.) Weight in S&P/IFCI Composite Index 2005 2010 Less than $3,000 per capita GDP 19% 13% Between $3,000 and $10,000 per capita GDP 41% 50% Greater than $10,000 per capita GDP 40% 36% Source: S&P/IFC, EIU, World Bank. GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 5 Exhibit 4 Growth: Demographics Play An Important Role Improvement in Demographics Has Played a Signifi cant Role in Increased Growth Rates Conversely, as baby boomers retire in the developed world, the dependency ratio will worsen and there will be fewer workers (as a proportion of the population) and the overall number of hours worked will decrease. The overall global effect will be to shift consumption (as a result of increasing income) from the developed world to the emerging world. Economic Changes + Demographic Shift = Huge Increase in Consumer Base With these global shifts in economics and demographics upon us, the focus of economic activity is likely to shift toward domestic demand providers within emerging markets. Exhibit 5 shows the number of people that one might term “middle class” (defi ned as having an income greater than $6,000) that will be added to the emerging markets over the next fi ve years (assuming the continuation of current growth rates). This number is far greater than the current population of the United States. We are very confi dent that, absent some global catastrophe, domestic demand in emerging market countries will be robust over the next few years, irrespective of what may or may not happen in the developed world. So, what could derail this story? The most likely candidate is oil rising to $200/barrel and staying there for an extended period. In general, very high commodity prices would have a major impact on consumption in emerging markets, and would shift potential return from domestic demand companies to commodity producers. * Percent of non-working to working people. Source: United Nations 6 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Exhibit 5 If Current Trends Persist, the Emerging Middle Class Will Increase by around 500 Million People in the Next 5 Years How Does One Take Advantage of This? Recently, we’ve been asked by a number of our clients if this anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue – the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities. At this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets and thus most multinationals do not represent a “pure play” on emerging domestic demand. For example, if we screen the MS World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50% of their sales from emerging markets, we fi nd 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574 billion and make up only 2.1% of the market value of the MSCI World Index. Exhibit 6 shows the 10 largest companies in this group – not exactly the household names one expects to see. -370 463 80 -500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Less than $6,000 (Below Middle Class) $6,000 to $30,000 (Middle Class) More Than $30,000 Millions Emerging Markets – Change in Consumer Base 2010-2015 70% of Europe Population Source: Goldman Sachs, World Bank GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 7 Exhibit 6 In addition, our view is that locally-domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home-fi eld advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from numerous sources, including high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well-established local brands, government policies that tend to favor locals, and the fact that local competitors are likely to have high profi tability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend – rather than build – their market share. A good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to be able to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia, it would be extremely expensive. In addition, they would have great diffi culty competing against a well-established player such as Magnit, which runs 4,000 plus stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20% (both of which allow it to make life very diffi cult for new entrants). We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build out its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where they paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefi ts of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future. This is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long-standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in countries like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profi tability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally-listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade-off between “pure-play” and valuation. For example, Domino’s Pizza has a market cap of $1.6 billion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3 billion, despite contributing less than 10% of the sales and 18% of the profi ts of the overall company. If our thesis of home fi eld advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past 5 years. Exhibit 7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive from a valuation point of view relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit 8 shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason domestic emerging companies outperformed was because their earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion. Name Country Market Value ($M) % Sales to EM QUALCOMM Inc.

As of 7/31/11 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 9 At the end of the day (as we mentioned earlier), it’s not about multinationals versus locals, but which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profi ts that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we fi nd that the best (but not all) opportunities are local. Not All Domestic Opportunities Are Attractive Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Similarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profi tability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profi tability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15 million net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profi tability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. Thus, high growth in this sector is unlikely to translate into high returns for shareholders. On the other hand, the fi nancial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well-established, highly profi table banks. Only 2% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefi t from this growth without having to lower their margins. The key is to look for fast-growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows for players to have high profi tability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profi tability in the face of non-linear demand increases are most attractive. Profi tability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter. In GMO parlance – focus on quality within fast-growing country/sectors. Conclusions As a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe that we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in the emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be refl ected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers. The winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home-fi eld advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well-established, high quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast-growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.

The GMO White Paper, released by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in August 2011, provides an in-depth analysis of the emerging consumer market for genetically modified (GM) foods. The paper highlights the growing interest in GM foods among consumers, particularly those who are concerned about the potential health risks associated with GM foods. The paper also discusses the challenges and opportunities presented by the emerging consumer market for GM foods.

The paper argues that the growing interest in GM foods among consumers is driven by a combination of factors, including the increasing awareness of the health risks associated with GM foods, the growing demand for GM foods as a substitute for traditional foods, and the growing concern about the environmental impact of GM foods. The paper also notes that the emerging consumer market for GM foods is characterized by a mix of consumers who are concerned about the health risks associated with GM foods, as well as those who are concerned about the environmental impact of GM foods.

In the 2000s, this mid-point demand occurred mainly in the form of commodity exports. Now, with a shrinking middle class in developed markets and a shrinking global demand for commodities, this mid-point demand is most likely to occur in emerging markets. So will we see commodity producers do well in the emerging markets? In the 1990s, Commodity producers generally did very well, as did companies that exported service products. In the 2000s, commodity producers generally

Go live with Country/Sector – many moving parts to this, will have to do major revisions to plumbing as we go along. Also, one should expect to make model changes through the year. I expect that we will spend a fair amount of time this year on the transition and on tuning. Getting this right is the key to the future of EMF. Fully implemented in Q1 and has had good performance this year
Go live with , both within EMF and as a stand alone strategy – bring in $$$. Much plumbing work to be done to integrate it with EMF. We will need refine the strategy and execution as we go along. Will take considerable time and effort on my part. Went live March 1 for the standalone and April 1 for the sleeve. Has been very successful from both a performance and asset raising point of view.
People
No expected change in personnel, except potentially to add to fundamental team depending on demands of . Train more people in the team (especially on the Fundamental side) to have client contact. Added a couple of people in fundamental. Matt Seto has been trained and now does solo client and prospect meetings.

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The topic discussed in the excerpt is Arjun 2012 Goals, which is a strategic plan for Arjun Corporation. The goal of the plan is to achieve a certain level of success in the coming year. The plan is divided into three main goals: financial, operational, and strategic. The financial goal is to increase revenue by 10% and reduce expenses by 5%. The operational goal is to increase sales by 15% and reduce costs by 10%. The strategic goal is to expand the company's market share and increase its market value by 20%.
The financial goal is a key part of the plan, as it is the foundation of the company's success. The plan aims to increase revenue by 10% and reduce expenses by 5%. This means that the company will need to increase its sales and reduce its costs to achieve this goal. The financial goal is important because it is the foundation of the company's success. If the company cannot increase its revenue and reduce its expenses, it will not be able to achieve its financial goals.
The operational goal is also important, as it is the foundation of the company's success. The plan aims to increase sales by 15% and reduce costs by 10%. This means that the company will need to increase its sales and reduce its costs to achieve this goal. The operational goal is important because it is the foundation of the company's success. If the company cannot increase its sales

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country picking strategies for EM, from 1976-2013. Figure 1 shows their results for equal weighted portfolios. Figure 1 There are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn – first, that value works (they use Div Yield as the proxy for value) to predict one year return. Second, that reversion strategies work – countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5 years. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12 month local real return) don’t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5 years GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1 year return. What We Did: First of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money. Figure 2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993- 2013. Figure 2 The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes. Figure 3 shows the same study, but now using square root mcap to define the quintiles and mcap weighting within each quintile. Figure 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Equal Weight 0 5 10 15 20 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Mcap Weight Again the results don’t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts). Since we think of value is being something different from Div Yield, we re-ran the equal weighted analysis replacing Div Yield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure 4 shows the results – clearly earnings yield works even better than Div Yield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone. Figure 4 Disentangling the effects: Looking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value – after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap. In order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12 month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value. Table 1 shows the T-stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non-overlapping periods). Table 1 T-Stat DivYld CtrySize Ret_1yrReal FXreturn GDP5yr GDPnext5yr Adjusted R^2 Just Yield 4.57 4.8% Yield and Country Size 4.71 1.38 5.0% Yield and Trailing 12 Month Return 4.31 -3.28 7.0% Yield and Currency Return 4.54 -2.34 5.8% Yield and Past 5Yr GDP Growth 4.47 -0.96 4.7% Yield and Future 5Yr GDP Growth 5.06 3.78 7.8% The one clear conclusion is that Past 5Yr GDP growth is a proxy for value – adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T-stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don’t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return. How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework? Last year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables – our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon – Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12 month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account /GDP (which we’ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value. Figure 5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999-2013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each subcomponent would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12 month forward returns. Figure 5 Figure 6 shows the same mcap weighted Figure 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Equal Weight 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Mcap Weight Overall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand-alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T-stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey-West T-stats, which (I’m told) correct for the serial correlation. Table 2 shows the regression for Earnings Yield by itself, which shows that for one extra unit of earnings yield; historically you got an extra 3.75% return. Table 2 Earnings Yield Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.75 7.0% T-Stat 12.01 Table 3 shows the same for Macro, with an additional unit exposure to this factor (its a normalized variable for one unit is one sigma) adding 10.47% return. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor Table 3 Macro Adjusted R- Squared Beta 10.47 1.1% T- Stat 6.37 Finally, when we combine both, we see that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone. Table 4 Earnings Yield Macro Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.71 9.74 8.0% T-Stat 11.86 6.27 Conclusions: D&M’s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth. We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past. In addition we found that one of D&M’s results, countries that had poor GDP growth over the past 5 years outperform, was simply an artifact of the fact those countries were cheaper. However, the fallen currency effect and the future GDP effects remain strong even after adjusting for value. We found that using sliced PE performed better than Div yield. Finally we looked at how our new Macro model would have done using this framework and concluded that it worked on a standalone basis, but more importantly did indeed represent an enhancement to our value models for picking countries.

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The concept presented here is the "Emerging Markets Country Selection" by Dimson and Marsh. This concept is a framework for selecting countries for investment in emerging markets. The authors of the paper argue that emerging markets are a significant opportunity for investors, but they also highlight the challenges and risks associated with investing in these countries.

The concept presented here has several market implications. Firstly, it suggests that investors should consider the potential for growth and development in emerging markets. Emerging markets are often characterized by high levels of economic growth, low inflation, and a growing middle class. These factors make emerging markets attractive to investors looking for opportunities for capital appreciation.

However, the concept also highlights the challenges and risks associated with investing in emerging markets. One of the main challenges is the lack of established infrastructure and regulatory frameworks in many emerging markets. This can make it difficult for investors to access capital and invest in the economy. Additionally, the high levels of political instability and corruption in many emerging markets can make it difficult for investors to invest in these countries.

Another risk associated with investing in emerging markets is the potential for political instability and corruption. This can make it difficult for investors to access capital and invest in the economy. Additionally, the high levels of political instability and corruption can make it difficult for investors to access capital and invest in the economy.

Overall, the concept presented here has several market implications. It suggests that investors should consider the potential for growth and development in emerging markets, but it also highlights the challenges and risks associated with

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Thoughts April 2018: Russia
“Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is,
Do you, Mr. Jones?”
Bob Dylan, Ballad of a Thin Man
That’s what it kind of feels like today, that there’s something going on behind the scenes beyond the obvious, but we are not privy to it.
The Russian market fell 10% on the back of new US sanctions and a chemical weapon attack in Syria. This is a much larger reaction than one would have expected. It’s not clear that the two situations (sanctions and Syria) are linked, but the market perceives that the risk of a major blowup with Russia (maybe Iran or North Korea style sanctions) has increased dramatically. We don’t buy it.
Our sources in Washington tell us that the new sanctions (and their timing) were a complete surprise to everyone in congress – that this was purely a White House operation. The fact that Mr. Oleg Deripaska (who is closely associated with Mr. Paul Manafort) and companies he controls was the main target would suggest that there’s a political dimension to this. If the intent was to hurt Russia economically, sanctioning companies such as Gazprom, Sberbank and Lukoil would have had a much more profound impact. Our sources in Moscow also suggest a similar view.
The new risk is that the White House is now actively involved with day to day Russia policy and everyone is uncertain as to what Mr. Trump might tweet tomorrow.
In short we don’t think the US is exercising the “nuclear option” of trying to tank the Russian economy and this action does not signal movement in that direction. While this action will cause pain in certain areas, we do not think it has a profound impact on the Russian economy. As a result, we are quite comfortable with our overweight in Russian equites, who continue to be extremely cheap.
Within the Russian market, Gazprom fell 8% while Sberbank fell almost 22%. Gazprom is very unlikely to be sanctioned because it supplies 30% of Europe’s natural gas and so makes sense that it would be less affected. 
On the other hand, we believe Sberbank’s dramatic fall reflects the fact that it is the most foreigner owned and most liquid Russian stock (the GDR trades an average of $100 million daily in London alone) and was hard hit for liquidity rather than fundamental reasons. Sberbank has only 3% of its assets exposed to companies that were sanctioned. It is Russia’s largest bank, with 20,000 branches and 65% of all deposits in the country. It trades at 5 times current earnings, 1.3 times book value while earning 23% return on equity. It is one of the largest positions in our portfolio and we are adding to it.

A: From the start of the Russian revolution in 1910, through the first half of the 20th century, Russia was part of the Soviet Union. After the war of 1914-1920, Russia gained independence and became an independent state. In 1920, the Bolsheviks took over and redefined themselves as the Communist Party. As a result, the Bolsheviks and their supporters were severely constrained in their ability to invest and spend money. While not an expert, what do you think about the implications of the above?
B: In 1921, the new country of Finland became independent. In that country, the Russophones formed a minority group and migrated to the Northerners. In the U.S., they formed a minority group and migrated to the Northerners. In the U.K., they formed a minority group and migrated to the Northerners. In the U.S. and Canada, they formed independent minorities and continued to do so. In short, they were able to have their own culture and identity before the Bolsheviks.
C: In 1922, the new country of Japan became independent. In that country, the Japonics formed a minority group and migrated to the Northerners. In the U.S., they formed a minority group and migrated to the Northerners. In the U.K., they formed a

EXPECTED ANSWER:
FROM Barra NEWSLETTER JULY/AUGUST 1993 Are Emerging Markets too Risky for You? Buy more and reduce risk! BY ARJUN DIVECHA Everyone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled "Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective," we show that investment in a well-diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio--through increased investments in emerging markets! Modest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk Exhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January, 1988 to December, 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years--it is true for any five year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created). This analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well-diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well-diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market capitalization weights, the right answer? Capitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions The case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight "overvalued" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight "undervalued" countries . In the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient. In such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is available to global investors. If market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 1 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting. If not market or GDP weights, then what? Another proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well-understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum-variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight. The theoretical basis for such a low-volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex post minimum-variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market- weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio. Thus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex ante forecast of the relative return of one vis-a-vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers2 have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles.3 Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk. This weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds). Such a methodology, without any constraints on the weights of each country, results in weights that are either unpalatable or uninvestable, from a global investor's point of view. As with any unconstrained optimization, one needs to be wary that the volatility minimization process does not lead to error maximization. It makes sense to set constraints on country weights based on the true investability of each country and the "prudent person" test (for example, no matter how good India may seem to the optimizer, no prudent person would put 80% of their money there). A nice idea, but does it work? We tested out this idea to see how it would have worked over the past five years. To make this a realistic strategy, we used a simple constraint: that each country's weight had to range from 50% to 200% of its market capitalization weight. This ensures that each country will have a weight that is reasonable and investable for the global investor. We chose the numbers, 50% and 200%, quite arbitrarily; for an actual investment the range should probably be tailored to the investability of each country and the risk aversion of the investor. We used the following methodology to construct the portfolios: 1) We chose from all the countries in the IFC Global Composite Index except for Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, and Indonesia. We deemed all of these (except for Indonesia for which adequate data was not available) to be uninvestable and/or uninteresting to the global investor. 2) We used the monthly total return, in U.S. dollars, to each market from January, 1985 to December, 1987 (36 months) to form the first variance-covariance matrix. Using this matrix and quadratic optimization, we found the LV portfolio for January, 1988 that met our constraint of 50% to 200% of market weight for each country. 3) We held this portfolio for 12 months, until the end of 1988. 4) We repeated steps 2 and 3 for each year from 1989 through 1992. At each year-end, we used the previous five years of data to compute the matrix (except for 1988, when only four years were available). 5) We then computed the return, in U.S. dollars, to the LV strategy and the IFC Global Index between January, 1988 and December, 1992. And the winner is ... http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 2 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM Exhibit 2 shows the results of the simulation. The LV portfolio did indeed have lower volatility than the IFC index, as expected. The finding that the LV portfolio outperformed the IFC index over the same time period is somewhat surprising. This would imply that the IFC index was almost certainly not MV efficient over this period--a further nail in the capitalization- weighting coffin. http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 3 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM We find that the realized volatility (annualized standard deviation of monthly returns) of the LV portfolio over this five-year period was 16.54%, compared to 23.39% for the IFC index. Exhibit 3 shows the 24-month rolling volatility over this time period; clearly, the LV portfolio had lower realized volatility than the IFC index over the entire time span. The results show that such an LV strategy would indeed have worked over the past five years. In our opinion, one can make a strong case for viewing the LV weights as the baseline for performance evaluation. More is better The analysis thus far has focused on how to weight the emerging markets among themselves. Now let's examine the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a global investor's portfolio. http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 4 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM Exhibit 4 shows the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a global portfolio. The choice of capitalization weights or LV weights doesn't seem to make much difference up to weights of 10% in the emerging markets, but the impact is quite dramatic after that. The strategy clearly leads to much greater risk reduction than the capitalization-weighted IFC Index. Additionally, whereas the lowest volatility of the IFC-FT mix is at approximately a 20% level of investment in emerging markets, the lowest risk point of the LV-FT mix is with an investment of between 40-50% in the emerging markets. Thus, using this methodology strengthens an already strong case for investments in the emerging markets. But wait, there's more... Still further risk reduction is possible. The current optimization computed country weights for the LV portfolio based on minimizing risk within the emerging markets, and I then used the LV portfolio as a single asset when combined with the world portfolio. Even further risk reductions would have resulted if the optimization to pick country weights had taken into account the investor's existing mix of countries and asset classes. The early bird gets the worm This significant risk reduction occurs primarily because emerging markets are uncorrelated to each other and to developed markets. These correlations will undoubtedly rise as economic and trade links increase among the emerging countries and the developed countries. As this happens, the "diversification free lunch" currently being served will diminish. Indulge while the opportunity exists! To conclude: modest investments in an emerging markets index fund would reduce the overall portfolio risk of a global investor; larger investments in a LV emerging market portfolio would lead to further risk reduction.

QUESTION 20:
What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Why we got Russia wrong In 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the ...

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Why we got Russia wrong In 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF). I have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, “The four most dangerous words in the English language are – This Time it’s Different”. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that’s why we got it wrong. We manage EMF with a focus on the top down – our view is (and has been for the entire 28 years period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60-70% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors. We do this in a primarily quantitative fashion – using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions – value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important. In addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance. This strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies. With that as background, let’s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis. Russia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum [BINU FIX THIS]. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation. So then the question became – in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether? Alas, we did not. What was our thinking behind this? We believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all out assault on the entire country, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes. But even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about-face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well. The issues in our minds are – what could/should have we done differently? First of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex-ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Lets assume that I’m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be to protect against black swan events, ie how much tail risk insurance should you buy? The answer I come to is the same I did prior to this – very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions. The next question is did we right size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide – our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not lead to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8-9%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years. In summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin’s eyes… China / Taiwan bekons…

I have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, “The four most dangerous words in the English language are – This Time it’s Different”. And it almost never is. Except now.It is almost certainly different this time and that’s why we got it wrong. We manage a portfolio of around 80 countries, each of which represents around 20% of global investment assets. When we look at our global portfolio this time, we see that Russia represents 14% of the overall portfolio, far from the 20% we were expecting. Instead, we have emens that represent 40% of the overall portfolio, when we expected it to be 14%.. So, what could have gone wrong? There are several potential reasons for the error. Russia was 3% of the market capitalization when the portfolio was created, the lowest level I remember. It was 14% by emem’s creation date (January 1994). Another possible reason is that we managed to get the math right on a number of occasions, such as when we crossed 10% of the market capitalization for the first time (in 1997) and when we crossed 20% (in 199
