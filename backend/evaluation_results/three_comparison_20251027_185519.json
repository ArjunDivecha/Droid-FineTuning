      "question": "What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: A closed mar- ket (and economy) such as India had negative cor- relations with ten out of the twenty...",
      "expected_answer": "A closed mar- ket (and economy) such as India had negative cor- relations with ten out of the twenty developed mar- kets. In fact, its average correlation with the developed markets was -0.01, with the highest being 0.23 with the Danish market! Clearly, the fact that the emerging markets (individually, and as a group) have low correlations with the developed markets implies that there is an opportunity for diversification. We can illustrate this with an example. Exhibit 7 shows the risk and return (over the past five years ending March 1991) of a glob- al portfolio as varying proportions of the IFC Emerg- ing Markets Index are stirred into the Financial Times World Index. Until reaching about 20% in the Emerging Markets Index, the risk of the overall portfolio decreases, because of the low correlations between the two. After that, portfolio risk starts increasing as the higher overall volatility of the Emerging Markets Index kicks in. Thus, even if one does not expect the emerging markets to outperform the developed markets, an investment of up to 20% would have EXHIBIT 7 IMPACT ON PORTFOLIO RISK FOR A GLOBAL INVESTOR Risk and Return for Mixes of FT World and IFC Emerging Markets Indkes (5 Years Ending March 1991) 2 0 T .

During this five-year period, the emerging markets outperformed the developed markets, so a 20% investment in emerging markets would not only have reduced annual risk by 0.81%, but would FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 49 have increased the annual return by 2.1% as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGERS Even though emerging markets are risky indi- vidually, low correlations between them and with developed markets lead to risk reduction for modest investments. As these markets develop greater links (financial and trade) with the developed markets, they will undoubtedly become more highly correlated. Thus, there is a \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d currently available -- one should indulge while the opportunity exists. One does not need to have high return forecasts for these :markets to enjoy the fruits of diversification. The flip side of the low correlations across mar- kets and homogeneity within markets is that country selection becomes more important for the active man- ager. There is greater volatility and greater return asso- ciated with country selection than in the developed markets. Managers interested in entering the emerging markets arena should give great consideration to their coun.try allocation process, perhaps more so than they do in the developed markets. This does not imply that stock selection by active managers is any less important or easier, simply that country selection has a bigger impact ori overall portfolio returns. To the extent that one decides to focus on coun.try selection rather than stock picking, the homo- geneity within markets comes to one\u2019s aid. A conse- quen.ce of the homogeneity within markets is that one can construct baskets of stocks that will mimic the per- form.ance of the overall market index with relatively low tracking error. This is particularly important in the emerging markets, because the smaller stocks tend to be extremely illiquid. Thus, one can form baskets of relatively liquid stocks that will track the overall index fairly well.. Exhibit 8 shows the number of stocks required to track the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX Index in Taiwan, and the S&P 500. If one wants to construct a basket (of stocks whose performance wdl track the relevant :index to within 1% per year (with a two- thirds probability), one would need about 75 stocks in Taiwan, 90 in Thailand, and 135 in the U.S.2 When one accounts for that fact that the Thai and Taiwanese EXHIBIT 8 COMPARISON OF TRACKING ERROIR IN DIFFERENT MARKETS Number of Stocks required to track tile Inde-K 0 100 200 300 400 500 Number of Stocks -X-Thailand -Taiwan --S&PS(Po 1 indexes have fewer stocks than the S&E\u2019 500, all three require about the same proportion of stocks to track the index with similar tracking error. Finally, given that many of the emerging mar- kets are projected to have higher real economic growth than the developed markets, one would expect that stock market return (over the medium to long term) would reflect this. Coupled with the diversification benefit, one can make a strong case for global investors to add investments in the emerging m.arkets to their portfolios.

      "expected_answer": "GMO North America | Europe | Australasia Emerging Thoughts \u2013 May 2004 \u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d Arjun Divecha Over the last 4 years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term. We examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it. Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries? Chart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid 1998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative underperformance over the next 12 months. What this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.

It\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, Macroeconomics and Judgment form 55% of our country selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver outperformance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion. We normally run our country selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets. Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small Cap Stocks? Looking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. What this chart shows is that value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount, the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15-year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively outperformed. In the last few months we have seen a similar contraction in the positioning of value in the U.S. and developed markets, but not to uncharted waters, which is where we are now in Emerging. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)? Chart 2: How Cheap Are Value Stocks? Value Stocks are Relatively Expensive 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Value of Cheap Stocks Relative to Benchmark October 2000: 46% Discount Current: 34% Discount Narrow Spread Wide Spread Normally Trade at 40% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts \u2013 May 2004 3 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia We have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing. So, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance. What Are We Doing About It? The question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d We first looked at \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive. Another group of stocks we follow quite closely is high quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today. Chart 3: How Cheap Are Small Stocks? Small Stocks Are Fairly Valued 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 1.05 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 October 2000: 32% Discount Current: 12% Discount Normally Trade at 16% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts \u2013 May 2004 4 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia GMO\u2019s experience suggests that markets systematically underprice quality. In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low-debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today. Over the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality-Adjusted-Value\u201d model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004. Chart 5: Quality Is Relatively Cheap 0.85 0.95 1.05 1.15 1.25 1.35 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Currently: 0% Premium Normally Trade at 9% Premium to Market Jan- Source: GMO Chart 4: How Attractive Are Growth* Stocks? 0.52 0.72 0.92 1.12 1.32 1.52 1.72 1.92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Jan- * Non-loss making companies that are forecast to have the highest 2 year growth Source: GMO Currently: 31% Premium Normally Trade at 23% Premium to Market Emerging Thoughts \u2013 May 2004 5 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia In the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality-Adjusted-Value\u201d model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts. Finally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other). Overall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier. What Should You Do About This? So, when you hear from us that our ability to add value is diminished, what\u2019s the appropriate response? When we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset allocation group\u2019s 7-year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset allocation products. Another response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs. Those of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar year end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index1, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way. We\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride. 1 The S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index is an independently maintained and published emerging market stock index.

      "expected_answer": "FROM Barra NEWSLETTER JULY/AUGUST 1993 Are Emerging Markets too Risky for You? Buy more and reduce risk! BY ARJUN DIVECHA Everyone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well-diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio--through increased investments in emerging markets! Modest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk Exhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January, 1988 to December, 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years--it is true for any five year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created). This analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well-diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well-diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market capitalization weights, the right answer? Capitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions The case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries . In the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient. In such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is available to global investors. If market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 1 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting. If not market or GDP weights, then what? Another proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well-understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum-variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight. The theoretical basis for such a low-volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex post minimum-variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market- weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio. Thus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex ante forecast of the relative return of one vis-a-vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers2 have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles.3 Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk. This weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds). Such a methodology, without any constraints on the weights of each country, results in weights that are either unpalatable or uninvestable, from a global investor's point of view. As with any unconstrained optimization, one needs to be wary that the volatility minimization process does not lead to error maximization. It makes sense to set constraints on country weights based on the true investability of each country and the \"prudent person\" test (for example, no matter how good India may seem to the optimizer, no prudent person would put 80% of their money there). A nice idea, but does it work? We tested out this idea to see how it would have worked over the past five years. To make this a realistic strategy, we used a simple constraint: that each country's weight had to range from 50% to 200% of its market capitalization weight. This ensures that each country will have a weight that is reasonable and investable for the global investor. We chose the numbers, 50% and 200%, quite arbitrarily; for an actual investment the range should probably be tailored to the investability of each country and the risk aversion of the investor. We used the following methodology to construct the portfolios: 1) We chose from all the countries in the IFC Global Composite Index except for Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, and Indonesia. We deemed all of these (except for Indonesia for which adequate data was not available) to be uninvestable and/or uninteresting to the global investor. 2) We used the monthly total return, in U.S. dollars, to each market from January, 1985 to December, 1987 (36 months) to form the first variance-covariance matrix. Using this matrix and quadratic optimization, we found the LV portfolio for January, 1988 that met our constraint of 50% to 200% of market weight for each country. 3) We held this portfolio for 12 months, until the end of 1988. 4) We repeated steps 2 and 3 for each year from 1989 through 1992. At each year-end, we used the previous five years of data to compute the matrix (except for 1988, when only four years were available). 5) We then computed the return, in U.S. dollars, to the LV strategy and the IFC Global Index between January, 1988 and December, 1992. And the winner is ... http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 2 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM Exhibit 2 shows the results of the simulation. The LV portfolio did indeed have lower volatility than the IFC index, as expected. The finding that the LV portfolio outperformed the IFC index over the same time period is somewhat surprising. This would imply that the IFC index was almost certainly not MV efficient over this period--a further nail in the capitalization- weighting coffin. http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 3 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM We find that the realized volatility (annualized standard deviation of monthly returns) of the LV portfolio over this five-year period was 16.54%, compared to 23.39% for the IFC index. Exhibit 3 shows the 24-month rolling volatility over this time period; clearly, the LV portfolio had lower realized volatility than the IFC index over the entire time span. The results show that such an LV strategy would indeed have worked over the past five years. In our opinion, one can make a strong case for viewing the LV weights as the baseline for performance evaluation. More is better The analysis thus far has focused on how to weight the emerging markets among themselves. Now let's examine the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a global investor's portfolio. http://www.barra.com/research/BarraPub/aemt-n.aspx 4 of 5 7/13/2010 10:48 AM Exhibit 4 shows the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a global portfolio. The choice of capitalization weights or LV weights doesn't seem to make much difference up to weights of 10% in the emerging markets, but the impact is quite dramatic after that. The strategy clearly leads to much greater risk reduction than the capitalization-weighted IFC Index. Additionally, whereas the lowest volatility of the IFC-FT mix is at approximately a 20% level of investment in emerging markets, the lowest risk point of the LV-FT mix is with an investment of between 40-50% in the emerging markets. Thus, using this methodology strengthens an already strong case for investments in the emerging markets. But wait, there's more... Still further risk reduction is possible. The current optimization computed country weights for the LV portfolio based on minimizing risk within the emerging markets, and I then used the LV portfolio as a single asset when combined with the world portfolio. Even further risk reductions would have resulted if the optimization to pick country weights had taken into account the investor's existing mix of countries and asset classes. The early bird gets the worm This significant risk reduction occurs primarily because emerging markets are uncorrelated to each other and to developed markets. These correlations will undoubtedly rise as economic and trade links increase among the emerging countries and the developed countries. As this happens, the \"diversification free lunch\" currently being served will diminish. Indulge while the opportunity exists! To conclude: modest investments in an emerging markets index fund would reduce the overall portfolio risk of a global investor; larger investments in a LV emerging market portfolio would lead to further risk reduction.

      "question": "What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong ...",
      "expected_answer": "Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong again. The prevailing view is that the rapid rise of gold prices over the past ten years has been caused by monetary authorities in the developed world debasing their currencies. By this logic, investors in the developed world have hedged debasement risk by pouring money into gold, both in the form of direct purchases and via ETFs. We believe that gold is an emerging markets asset as much as it is a bet against the Federal Reserve and much of the rise in gold prices has been driven by purchases by emerging consumers, who are driven primarily by \u201cfinancial repression\u201d. The traditional framework used to analyze gold starts with the assumption that gold is the ultimate store of value. Along these lines, if faith in paper currencies wanes, the price of gold should then rise. Consequently, gold prices should be highly correlated to inflation. The traditional barometer for inflation and weak central banks and thus gold, is US inflation. This line of reasoning does provide some insight. Changes in US inflation do explain gold price movements until 2000. Through the 70s, 80s and 90s, changes in gold the gold price were matched by changes in the inflation rate. Nonetheless, we believe \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d is naive. It fails to explain the last 10 years. Befuddling conventional wisdom, gold prices climbed from $300/oz. in 1999 to the current $1,700, while actual inflation and expected inflation remained very well behaved, staying between 0% and 5% through this duration. The missing factor is emerging markets. Gold purchases over the past 10 years have increasingly been derived from emerging markets, especially emerging Asian countries (with India, China and Vietnam representing the largest change). Whereas in 1999, emerging markets accounted for only xx% of global gold demand, by 2010 this figure had reached 79% and has increased since then. Chart 1 shows that emerging Asia\u2019s share of global gold demand has increased from 39% of global demand in 1999 to 57% by 2010 and is concomitant with the rapid rise in gold prices. In fact, as Chart 2 shows, in dollar terms, emerging Asian purchases of gold have risen from about $10 billion in 1999 to $70 billion in 2010. Chart 3 shows aggregate demand of gold from 2000 to 2010. A total of 29,342 tons of gold were purchased for both investment and jewelry. Key observations: Developed market purchases of gold bars and jewelry accounted for 7,200 tons or 25%. Despite all the attention in the media, ETFs only accounted for 2,200 tons, less than 7.5% of the total. Central banks were net sellers of 3,300 tons, even as the Chinese and Russian central banks purchased 1,050 tons. Retail from emerging markets totaled over 23,200 tons, a staggering 79% of total demand, far and away the primary demand component over this period China and India alone combined for a total of 9,000 tons, a figure that\u2019s more than the developed world as a whole and four times aggregate ETF demand. The data shows that the bets against the Federal Reserve over the past decade were a pretty small part of the total demand. Instead, the really big bets were of a different flavor and originating almost entirely from emerging markets. We believe the interplay between tremendous growth in household savings in emerging markets coupled with \u201cfinancial repression\u201d has been fuelling this emerging markets gold factor. Because of capital controls which severely restrict money outflows, Chinese and Indian residents are essentially forced to either deposit their savings in a bank or invest in local equities. Governments regulate deposit rates, forcing negative real rates. Moreover, local equity markets are often incomplete. Recent dismal performance of these equity markets has not been encouraging either. Gold jewelry and gold bars, along with real estate are the most prominent of few alternatives. Coupled with this \u201cfinancial repression\u201d, savings in emerging markets rose dramatically in both relative and absolute terms between 2000 and 2010. In 2000, EM accounted for xx% of global GDP and by 2010 this figure was xx%. Domestic savings in China rose from a 41% average in the 90s to 47% in the 2000s, India\u2019s savings rate rose from 23% to 29%. Consequently, combined gross savings in India and China increased from $557bn in 2000 to $3.4trn in 2010. Essentially, there was an enormous increase of money available to invest, and given the lack of good alternatives, gold was a preferred destination. The point is that the main driver for gold\u2019s dramatic rise has been the emerging markets consumer. This is not to say that the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d drivers for gold are not relevant. We believe they are. However, we believe they have not been material for the past 10 years The implications for gold\u2019s outlook are both negative and positive. On one hand, gold prices may be at risk if emerging market economies slow down, or worse, experience a hard landing. It\u2019s estimated that Indian households currently own 18,000 tons of gold, the equivalent of seven or eight years of global demand. If India were to experience a significant slowdown, some of this gold may go to market, although Indians have historically held onto their gold in bad times. Even in the scenario that EM economies maintain their momentum, gold would be negatively impacted if \u201cfinancial repression\u201d eases and India and China loosen capital controls and allow assets to flow outside the country. On the other hand, this analysis indicates that \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d demand is far from saturated. Central banks have been net sellers of gold. Gold remains a small percent of overall reserves. Similarly, gold as a percentage of the liquid portfolio in the developed market remains untapped. These latter two reasons indicate that gold prices may very well experience another leg up. Our point is not make predictions about the price of gold, but to create awareness that emerging markets represent a significant factor in how gold is being, as will be priced in the future.

      "expected_answer": "Emerging Thoughts: \nBuying small cap stocks in emerging markets is the best way to access burgeoning domestic demand: \ne believe that one of the most compelling investment  opportunities over the next few years is likely to be in companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets  (see the recent GMO White Paper entitled \u201cWhat Happens In Emerging, Stays in Emerging\u201d). \nAs this domestic demand play gains momentum, we increasingly hear that the best way to capture this theme is through buying small cap stocks in emerging markets. We believe this is a mistake.  In this paper, we make the case that small caps are NOT a good proxy for domestic demand and that focusing on companies that specifically serve domestic demand is a more effective means to exploit the opportunity.  Besides, why buy a proxy when you can buy the real thing?\nFirst let\u2019s look at  argument.   Favoring small cap  on the presumption that large caps in emerging markets are mainly focused on export and globally oriented businesses. As a result, removing these large cap names from the investable universe will leave a universe of companies that are largely focused on domestic demand. The first part of this contention is true, the second is not. Large caps are highly geared to global demand. However, the small cap universe alone does not represent a pure play on domestic demand\nFigure 1 shows the sector weights of Small Cap and Broad Emerging universes*, separated into sectors that are domestically oriented (Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Telecoms and Utilities) and those that are globally sensitive (Energy, Materials, Technology and most Industrials). As the chart clearly shows, globally sensitive sectors are almost as highly represented in aggregate in the small cap universe as in the broad universe. In fact globally sensitive sectors represent45% of the small cap universe vs. 47% for the broad universe as of Sept 2011. \nInstead of using a simplistic approach to accessing domestic demand opportunities by using small caps as a proxy, what if we were to build a universe of companies that serve domestic demand, based on who their ultimate customer is, rather than market capitalization? This universe would eliminate all companies that primarily serve global demand, determined on a company by company basis by looking at their financial statements investigative work and strong fundamental analysis.  \nFigure 2 shows sector weights of this true domestic demand universe alongside that of the small cap universe. We see that the domestic universe has a far lower exposure to globally sensitive sectors than the small cap universe. In fact, even the companies represented within globally sensitive sectors of the domestic universe are those that specifically serve domestic demand such as technology companies whose business is primarily within emerging markets rather than those that export to developed countries. An example of this would be Kingdee International, which provides Chinese language ERP software and services and competes with the likes of SAP for small and medium size businesses in China. \n.\nLast, but not least, not all domestic demand in emerging is served by companies domiciled within emerging markets. Global multinationals also serve this rising demand and in some cases, are dominant players. A complete universe focusing on domestic demand should include these multinationals, especially ones that receive a substantial part of their earnings/revenues from  emerging markets. These multinationals will never be part of the emerging market small cap universe, and while they represent a small part of the domestic demand universe at the current time, we should expect them to become a larger part of the domestic demand opportunity as their earnings and revenues from emerging markets continue to grow. Examples range from relatively new entrants like Yum Brands (which owns and operates the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchises) to Unilever (which set up a local subsidiary in India in 1931 and has been listed on the Indian stock market since 1956). \nTo conclude, the best way to access demand from burgeoning middle class in the emerging markets is to invest in companies that directly serve that demand, rather than using emerging markets small caps as a proxy. \n In short, \n* The broad universe includes all companies represented in union of the S&P/IFC EM Investable Universe and the MSCI EM Universe weighted by investable capitalization \u2013 about 3,500 companies. The Small Cap universe represents the bottom 25% of the broad universe by market capitalization, about 2,700 companies.",

      "expected_answer": "GMO North America | Europe | Australasia Emerging Thoughts \u2013 May 2004 \u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d Arjun Divecha Over the last 4 years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term. We examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it. Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries? Chart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid 1998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative underperformance over the next 12 months. What this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.

It\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, Macroeconomics and Judgment form 55% of our country selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver outperformance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion. We normally run our country selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets. Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small Cap Stocks? Looking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. What this chart shows is that value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount, the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15-year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively outperformed. In the last few months we have seen a similar contraction in the positioning of value in the U.S. and developed markets, but not to uncharted waters, which is where we are now in Emerging. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)? Chart 2: How Cheap Are Value Stocks? Value Stocks are Relatively Expensive 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Value of Cheap Stocks Relative to Benchmark October 2000: 46% Discount Current: 34% Discount Narrow Spread Wide Spread Normally Trade at 40% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts \u2013 May 2004 3 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia We have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing. So, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance. What Are We Doing About It? The question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d We first looked at \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive. Another group of stocks we follow quite closely is high quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today.

In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low-debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today. Over the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality-Adjusted-Value\u201d model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004. Chart 5: Quality Is Relatively Cheap 0.85 0.95 1.05 1.15 1.25 1.35 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Currently: 0% Premium Normally Trade at 9% Premium to Market Jan- Source: GMO Chart 4: How Attractive Are Growth* Stocks? 0.52 0.72 0.92 1.12 1.32 1.52 1.72 1.92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Jan- * Non-loss making companies that are forecast to have the highest 2 year growth Source: GMO Currently: 31% Premium Normally Trade at 23% Premium to Market Emerging Thoughts \u2013 May 2004 5 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia In the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality-Adjusted-Value\u201d model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts. Finally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other). Overall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier. What Should You Do About This? So, when you hear from us that our ability to add value is diminished, what\u2019s the appropriate response? When we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset allocation group\u2019s 7-year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset allocation products. Another response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs. Those of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar year end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index1, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way. We\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride. 1 The S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index is an independently maintained and published emerging market stock index.

The article also discusses the potential benefits of GMO, such as increased yields, resistance to pests and diseases, and the ability to produce food that is not affected by human activity. The author also discusses the concerns that have been raised about GMO, such as the potential for GMO to escape into the food chain, the impact on biodiversity, and the potential for GMO to lead to a loss of genetic diversity. The article concludes that while GMO has the potential to be used effectively to increase food production, it is important to have proper regulations in place to ensure that GMO is used safely and responsibly, and that the benefits of GMO are not used to justify harm",

      "expected_answer": "GMO EMERGING THOUGHTS January 2011 Ruminations on China and India Arjun Divecha China: If you build it, they will come\u2026 India: You\u2019re not going to build it, but they\u2019ll come anyway\u2026 I t occurred to me that this is a good metaphor for China and India and the resulting implications for growth and investment return. Last month I had a long chat with one of the people in China whose views I most respect. He is extremely plugged in with the fi nancial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefi t. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions. In my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and fi nancial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today. That, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long-term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital? One of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by Edward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high-speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure fi nancial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high-speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high-speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high-speed rail in expansive continental geographies. In short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital. Now, let\u2019s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have diffi cult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years). The one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government actually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song).

References to specific securities and issuers are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to be, and should not be interpreted as, recommendations to purchase or sell such securities. The portfolio weightings are current only as of the date indicated and are subject to change. none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profi ts by investing in telecoms outside of India. This is what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high profi ts because producers benefi ted from shortages. Another interesting consequence of bad policy-making (India consistently runs high budget defi cits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high-return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefi ts investors by delivering high return on investment. Now this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India benefi ts from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high- cost-of-capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth. I believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to grow. We already see infl ation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High infl ation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high-infl ation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs. Nevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom- up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state-directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profi t- maximizers. In the fi nal analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profi tability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors. In short, don\u2019t focus on growth. Focus on profi tability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation \u2013 we are willing to pay a premium for profi tability, but not to overpay for it. Current positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring infl ation down, a task that is made much harder by the profl igate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.",

      "expected_answer": "Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country picking strategies for EM, from 1976-2013. Figure 1 shows their results for equal weighted portfolios. Figure 1 There are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn \u2013 first, that value works (they use Div Yield as the proxy for value) to predict one year return. Second, that reversion strategies work \u2013 countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5 years. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12 month local real return) don\u2019t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5 years GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1 year return. What We Did: First of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money. Figure 2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993- 2013. Figure 2 The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes. Figure 3 shows the same study, but now using square root mcap to define the quintiles and mcap weighting within each quintile. Figure 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Equal Weight 0 5 10 15 20 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Mcap Weight Again the results don\u2019t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts). Since we think of value is being something different from Div Yield, we re-ran the equal weighted analysis replacing Div Yield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure 4 shows the results \u2013 clearly earnings yield works even better than Div Yield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone. Figure 4 Disentangling the effects: Looking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value \u2013 after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap. In order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12 month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value. Table 1 shows the T-stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non-overlapping periods). Table 1 T-Stat DivYld CtrySize Ret_1yrReal FXreturn GDP5yr GDPnext5yr Adjusted R^2 Just Yield 4.57 4.8% Yield and Country Size 4.71 1.38 5.0% Yield and Trailing 12 Month Return 4.31 -3.28 7.0% Yield and Currency Return 4.54 -2.34 5.8% Yield and Past 5Yr GDP Growth 4.47 -0.96 4.7% Yield and Future 5Yr GDP Growth 5.06 3.78 7.8% The one clear conclusion is that Past 5Yr GDP growth is a proxy for value \u2013 adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T-stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don\u2019t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return. How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework? Last year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12 month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account /GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value. Figure 5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999-2013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each subcomponent would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12 month forward returns. Figure 5 Figure 6 shows the same mcap weighted Figure 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Equal Weight 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Mcap Weight Overall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand-alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T-stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey-West T-stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the serial correlation. Table 2 shows the regression for Earnings Yield by itself, which shows that for one extra unit of earnings yield; historically you got an extra 3.75% return. Table 2 Earnings Yield Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.75 7.0% T-Stat 12.01 Table 3 shows the same for Macro, with an additional unit exposure to this factor (its a normalized variable for one unit is one sigma) adding 10.47% return. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor Table 3 Macro Adjusted R- Squared Beta 10.47 1.1% T- Stat 6.37 Finally, when we combine both, we see that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone. Table 4 Earnings Yield Macro Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.71 9.74 8.0% T-Stat 11.86 6.27 Conclusions: D&M\u2019s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth. We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past. In addition we found that one of D&M\u2019s results, countries that had poor GDP growth over the past 5 years outperform, was simply an artifact of the fact those countries were cheaper. However, the fallen currency effect and the future GDP effects remain strong even after adjusting for value. We found that using sliced PE performed better than Div yield. Finally we looked at how our new Macro model would have done using this framework and concluded that it worked on a standalone basis, but more importantly did indeed represent an enhancement to our value models for picking countries.

Such markets have become more accessible to the global investor. Today, there are several country funds through which investors can participate in even \u201cclosed\u201d or restricted markets. Investment wdl become easier as more countries dismantle barriers to direct foreign investment. This article presents recent research into the emerging markets from a quantitative point of view. We have developed a model for understanding the forces that drive these markets, which affords some insights for global investors. We find that while the emerging markets are more volatile than developed markets, they tend to be relatively uncorrelated with each other and with developed markets. Thus, contrary to popular belief, modest investment in the emerging markets leads to lower, rather than higher, portfolio risk for the glob- al investor (see also Brown [1991]). Over the past five years, a global investor who put 20% in an emerging markets index fund would have reduced overall annual portfolio risk from 18.3% to 17.5% while increasing annual return from 12.6% to 14.7%. One unexpected result of our research is that stock returns in the emerging markets tend to be more homogeneous than in developed markets, implying that a strong market force dominates industry and stock-specific influences. In short, when the market moves, everyone goes along for the ride. FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 41 WHICH MARKETS ARE CONSIDERED EMERGING MARKETS? EXHIBIT 1 Emerging Market Characteristics Just what is considered an emerging market is frequently a matter of opinion. Narrowly defined, an emerging market: 0 Has securities that trade in a public market. Is not a developed market (as defined by countries covered within the Morgan Stanley Capital Inter- national Indices or Financial Times Indices). Is of interest to global institutional investors. Has a reliable source of data. 0 Exhibit 1 lists the countries that we consider to be ernerging markets. They fall into three regions: Asia, Latin America, and Europe/Middle East/Africa. Singapore and Hong Kong fall into most definitions of developed markets, but are included here because they are closely related to the other Asian markets. Colom- bia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, and Zimbabwe are not of great institutional interest at present, although Pak- istan has recently opened up its economy and financial markets to foreign investors and may well be next on the list of emerging markets to attract institutional interest. Finally, Japanese over-the-counter (OTC) stocks are included in the list because they tend to behave (and are perceived) differently from listed Japanese st:ocks. R E T W I S AND RISKS OF EMERGING MARKETS The casual reader of the financial press knows there have been stories of incredible returns (high and low) in the emerging markets. The Venezuelan stock market was up about 450% in U.S. dollar terms during 1990. On the other hand, the Taiwanese Stock Exchange Index started out 1990 at about the 5,000 level, went up to 12,600 during the first quarter and collapsed 110 near 2,500 during the third quarter. What makes this even more interesting is that the Taiwanese market is only the fourth or fifth most risky emerging market! During the first half of 1991, Latin American countries dominated all others; in U.S. dollar terms, they were up over 100%. Overall, the emerging markets have done better than the 'developed markets over the past five years.

Exhibit 1 shows predicted risks according to BARRA's risk model of each of the emerging markets as well as for a few developed markets. Clearly, these 42 EMERGINZ MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 markets are extremely risky when compared with developed markets. Apart from the obvious risks (political instability, insider trading, etc.), there are a number of possible reasons why these markets are extremely volatile. First, they tend to be fairly concentrated; that is, the larger stocks have a high proportion of the over- all market capitalization. As a result, there are fewer opportunities for diversification, and returns to these large stocks dominate the overall market return. Sec- ond, unlike the developed markets, which tend to have forces that affect diverse sectors of the economy differ- ently, the emerging markets tend to have a strong mar- ket-related force that affects all stocks within a market. This tends to accentuate volatility. There are some apparent anomalies in these results. Palustan, Jordan, Colombia, Nigeria, and Zim- babwe appear to have had relatively low risk over the last five years. We believe that these low figures reflect the lack of liquidity in these markets, so observed volatilities (and correlations with other markets) must be viewed with caution. When we look at the turnover ratio (value tradedlmarket capitalization) for each market, we find that these five markets rank in the bottom six (shown in Exhibit 1). The real volatility is likely to be much higher, if and when these markets become more liquid. When we look at the emerging markets as a group (the BARRA Emerging World Universe of about 4,000 stocks), we find that it has much lower volatility than most of the individual markets. This is because of low correlations between these markets. The diversification that these low correlations offer the global investor is one of the biggest benefits of invest- ing in the emerging markets. The volatility (over the past five years) of the BARRA Emerging World Uni- verse was about 28.0%, as compared to about 18.8% for the S&P 500 or 22.8% for the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia, and the Far East (EAFE) index. A MODEL TO UNDERSTAND RISK AND RETURN To analyze risk and return in these markets, we developed a multi-factor model similar to one previous- ly constructed for the developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek [1989]). At the core of the model is a hierarchical decomposition of portfolio return into vari- ous components. This is dustrated in E h b i t 2. EXHIBIT 2 EMERGING MARKETS MODEL We focus on excess return, return beyond the risk-free rate. This return is initially broken down into currency return and excess return earned in local mar- kets. Local excess return is decomposed further into country factor return, industry return, and return accruing to salient attributes of the companies in the portfolio, e.g. the price/earnings ratio. These latter sources of return are called risk indexes. The return to a global portfolio depends on the numeraire or home country of the investor. More pre- cisely, the excess return to an investment abroad is the product of the return of the investment in its local market, 1 + r1, and the exchange return 1 + r,. With a little manipulation, this can be expressed as the sum of three components: Excess Numeraire Return = (r, + rfl - rd - (ri - rfl) + r, x q, or, (1) Currency Return - Local Excess Return + Cross-Product where rf is the risk-free rate of return in the country of the investor, and rfl is the risk-free rate in the market where the investment is being made. The first term in Equation (1) is the currency return, reflecting both the exchange return and the differential in interest rates between countries. The second term is the local excess return of the investment in its own market. The final term, r, x r1 (also known as the cross- product) poses a problem for development of a linear model. For most countries, this cross-product term is FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 43 typically small and can be disregarded for the purposes of forecasting risk. For example, ignoring the cross- product reduces the annual risk of the Korean market by 51 basis points (from 29.62% to 29.11%), and of the Taiwanese market by 103 basis points. In such cases, one can sa.fely ignore the cross-product because it is small relative to overall market risk. This is not true for Argentina or Brazil, where there are huge swings in exchange rates. Over the past five years, ignoring the cross-product would have changed the annual risk of the Argentinean market by 17% and the Brazilian market by 4%. To circumvent this difficulty, we do not try to decompose the Brazilian and Argentinean asset returns into local and currency components but rather model these assets from the U.S. perspective. In other words, we trans1at:e the prices of Brazilian and Argentinean assets into U.S. dollars and model the U.S. dollar- denomina,ted returns of these assets. Happily, this approach :is consistent with investors\u2019 tendency to think of these assets in U.S. dollars. Next, local excess return is broken down into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk index return. The amount of an asset\u2019s riturn arising from each component depends on its exposure to that source. The exposure of an asset to the country factor is its beta with respect to that mar- ket. Moreover, assets are exposed only to their own local markets. In contrast, industry and risk indexes are global factors in the model, i.e., it is assumed that these factors apply equally across countries. Industry exposure is defined using the Financial Times Wcdd industry classification. Each asset is assigned to exactly one of the thirty-six industry cate- gories. The risk indexes include size, success, yield, variability in markets, earnings-to-price ratio, book- to-price ra.tio, and liquidity. Exposures to these risk indexes are normalized within each country. Thus, these exposures measure how an asset compAres to the rest of its local market. A formal statement of our model for monthly local excess return is for asset n: Local Excess = Country Factor + Industry Factor + Risk Index Factor + Specific Return 44 EMERGING MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE where asset n the ith f(i) are k = 1, number of countries j = 1, number of industries i = 1, number of risk indexes P(n,k), y(n,j), and x(n,i) are the exposures of to the kth country factor, the jth industry, and risk index, respectively. Variables h(k), g(j), and returns to these factors. In estimating the factor returns, the exposures are determined from the begin- ning of month data. The part of the return that is not explained by these factors is called the specific return, u(n); it is unique to the company. The model was estimated for assets fbrn the twen- ty-three markets listed in Exhibit 1 over the period Febru- ary 1986 to July 1991. Data are drawn from numerous sources includmg the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources in thirteen countries. The results of the modeling process reveal some interesting differences between emerging and devel- oped markets. The overall proportion of variance explained by the emerging markets model (adjusted R2 ) is 50%, as compared with 38% for a :similar model that covers the developed markets (countries covered by the Financial Times Indices). At first glance it may seem surprising that a quantitative model would explain a greater proportion of return in the emerging markets than the developed markets. In order to understand this further, we looked at two submodels. The first submodel was built using only indus- try factors; i.e., we looked at what proportion of return is explained by the industry that a company is in, ignoring the country factors and :risk indexes. Thus, a definition of this model is: (3) Local Excess Return = Industry Fa.ctor + Specific Return We find the adjusted R2 for this rnodel for the emerging markets to be 16%, compared with 22% for the developed markets. This is a measure of how \u201cglobal\u201d or integrated industries are across countries. It stands to reason that the developed rnarkets have industries that are better integrated than the emerging ones, but the fact that the difference is small implies that there are cross-country industry commonalities in the emerging markets as well. The second submodel was built using only FALL 1992 country factors. Thus, we looked at what proportion of return is explained by country factors alone, ignor- ing the industry factor and risk indexes. The definition of this model is: Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return The adjusted R2 for this model for the emerg- ing markets is 46% compared with 30% for the devel- oped markets. Clearly, this country factor is the major force driving emerging markets. As one would expect, industries play a larger part in explaining return in the developed markets, while country differences play a larger role in the emerging markets. HOMOGENEITY WITHIN MARKETS The fact that country factors explain such a large proportion of variance (in absolute terms and when compared with the developed markets) in the emerging markets bears a closer look. That is, stock returns tend to be more homogeneous (within a market) in the emerging markets than in developed markets. In other words, when the market moves, there is a strong ten- dency for all stocks in the market to move with it. This difference in the proportion of return explained by the market factor (46% in emerging mar- kets versus 30% in developed countries) is not a func- tion of capitalization weighting (which leads to larger companies dominating the regression). Even when we equally weight each stock in the regression we find the same effect persists. The comparable R2 when equally weighting all stocks in the emerging markets is 42% (compared with 29% in the developed markets). At first appearance, it may seem odd that the proportion of variance explained by the market factor is so large in these markets. In order to understand this, we look at various effects that may cause this to happen. First, it may result from a concentration effect, a few large companies so dominating the market that they are, in effect, the market. Second, it may well be that these markets are actually more homogeneous (i.e., all the stocks tend to move together). Finally, there tends to be a positive correlation between the magnitude of returns within a market and the R2, i.e., to some extent, the high R2 is a natural by-product of high volatility. We first look at the concentration effect; that is, whether these markets tend to be dominated by a few large stocks. Exhibit 3 shows the proportion of market capitalization that the top ten stocks represent in each market. Most emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets. Hong Kong and Singa- pore, perhaps the two most developed of the emerging markets, are highly concentrated by this measure. On the other hand, Malaysia, Brazil, Inla, and Korea are not signlficantly more concentrated than the U.K. Of course, simply looking at the biggest ten stocks in a market is not a particularly insightful way to judge con- centration because it ignores all the other companies. Exhibit 3 shows two other more meaningful measures of concentration: asset concentration and sector concentration. Concentration is defined as (sim- ilar to Roll [1990]): Concentration = [(N/N - 1) x C(h, - l/N)2]0.5 (5) where: N = Total number ofstocks (or industries), and h, = Weight in asset (or industry) n. Asset concentration looks at how different a market is from being equally weighted. If each stock in the market had exactly the same market capitalization, this measure would be zero. If the entire market capi- talization were concentrated in one company, the mea- sure would be one. In an extremely diversified market like the U.S., the score is 0.08. Looking at this measure for the emerging markets, we can clearly see that they are more concentrated, but that the larger ones (Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.) tend to have numbers that are not much larger than the developed markets The average for these four markets is 0.13. Thus, while asset concentration plays an important role in understanding why these markets appear homoge- neous, there must be other factors at work as well. Another measure of concentration is sector concentration. If most of the stocks in a market are concentrated in one industry, it would make sense that they would tend to move together. Exhlbit 3 shows a measure of sector concentration, defined in a similar FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 45 EXHIBIT 3 Emergjng Market Statistics ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~~~ ~ Proportion of Average Capitalization Asset Sector Correlation in Top 10 Concentration Concentration Between Stocks Couni:ry Companies(%) * Factor Factor Argentina Brazil Chile Colombia Greece 65.60 26.60 50.90 75.10 50.40 0.26 0.17 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.43 0.38 0.26 0.39 0.44 0.92 0.70 0.59 0.34 0.72 Hong Kong India Indonesia Japan QTC Jordan 45.20 29.40 53.40 28.40 66.20 0.17 0.13 0.17 0.15 0.55 0.44 0.48 0.43 0.32 0.62 0.69 0.55 0.71 0.34 0.21 Korea Malaysia Mexico Nigeria Pakistan 28.90 25.10 38.40 52.50 24.40 0.16 0.12 0.21 0.17 0.14 0.28 0.28 0.42 0.66 0.33 0.56 0.57 0.70 0.23 0.17 Philippines Portugal Singapore Taiwan Thailand 65.20 44.20 54.50 41.30 32.70 0.33 0.17 0.18 0.13 0.11 0.57 0.40 0.46 0.37 0.42 0.70 0.80 0.75 0.77 0.47 Turkey Venezuela Zimbabwe 53.10 64.20 41.20 0.23 0.26 0.25 0.36 0.49 0.43 0.81 0.60 0.25 Developed Markets Japan 16.70 0.08 0.29 0.46 U.K. 25.50 0.11 0.30 0.56 U.S. 11.90 0.08 0.32 0.49 *Source: International Finance Corporation fashion as asset concentration. A score of zero implies that companies are equally distributed across all indus- tries, while a score of one implies that all the compa- nies are in one industry. The indication is that the emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets, but not much more so (although there is a popular percep- tion that inany emerging market countries are highly concentrated in certain sectors). In fact we see that Korea, Ckile, and Malaysia have less sector concentra- tion than the U.S., U.K., and Japan. The countries that are most highly concentrated in a few sectors are the smaller ones like Jordan and Nigeria. It seems clear from these results that the emerging markets are quite diversified across industries; the perception that their returns are driven by the fortunes of a single sector (like natural resources) is erroneous. What then explains the fact that stocks in these markets tend to move together? We looked at the pos- sibility that these markets are indeed more homoge- neous, after adjusting for the concentration effect. One way to do ths is to look at the average correlation of total monthly stock returns within a market, over a period of time. Exhibit 3 shows the average (i.e., unweighted) correlation between all stocks within each market (over the past five years). 46 EMEILGINI; MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 This is clearly higher for most of the emerging markets than the developed markets. With the excep- tion of the Japanese OTC market, all the other large emerging markets have high average correlations. Tai- wan has an average correlation of 0.77, Turkey 0.81, and Brazil 0.70. By comparison, the U.S. has an aver- age correlation of 0.49 and Japan 0.46. Because these correlations are unweighted, market capitalization does not play a role in determining this number. This implies that a single market force tends to have a large impact on the movement of stock prices in these markets. Even though we saw that these mar- kets are fairly well-diversified across industries, these industry differentials are overwhelmed by the domi- nant market force. Another reason for the high R2 numbers in the emerging markets is the fact that there is likely to be a positive relationship between R2 and market voladity. For example, if the market moves up 50% in a month, the likelihood is that almost all stocks in that market will also move up. Thus, one would expect to see higher R2 for the more volatile markets. We find that this is indeed true; if one excludes the most risky mar- kets (Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan), and the low liquidity ones (Pakistan, Jordan, Colombia, Nige- ria, and Zimbabwe) the average R2 for the emerging markets is s i d a r to that for the developed markets. Overall, from a global investor\u2019s viewpoint, this homogeneity phenomenon implies that being in the right market at the right time is more important than the ability to pick good stocks within that market. Clearly, if you are going to be in Brazil in a month when the market moves up 50%, the high within-mar- ket correlations (0.70 for Brazil) are likely to ensure that any diversified portfolio will experience high pos- itive returns. From a global investor\u2019s point of view, the impact of this conclusion is accentuated by the low across-market correlations. HETEROGENEITY ACROSS MARKETS This phenomenon of homogeneity does not apply across markets. In fact, we see that the emerging markets are much less correlated with each other than are the developed markets. Exhibit 4 shows the corre- lations of emerging markets with each other.

We propose two explanations as to why they have been uncorrelated with each other. First, many of the emerging markets have (or had) few economic and trade lir ks with each other. Consequently, their economies tend to be unrelated to each other. Second, many have (or had) severe restrictions on outsiders participating in their markets. Therefore, they are somewhat insulated from worldwide (or even regional) patterns in stock market returns. For example, in October 1987, while the world's markets were crashing, the Indian stock market was up mod- estly. Nlow the current trend is for most of the emerging economies to develop greater trade links with the developed world and each other. Most of the countries that are closed to foreign participation in their stock markets are also in the process of liberaliz- ing rules for foreigners to participate in their markets. With these increasing links between markets, we should expect to see correlations between the emerg- ing markets increase in the future. When we contrast these low correlations with the correlations between developed markets (Exhibit 5), we see that they have much higher correlations with each other. A quick glance at Exhibits 4 and 5 confirms that the developed markets are much more correlated with each other than the emerging markets are. The average correlation between the developed markets was 0.49 (over the same five-year period). While all the correlations between the developed mar- kets were positive, 89 of the 276 correlations between the emerging markets were negative (over this five- year period). From a global investor's point of view, a more interesting question is not so much how the emerg- ing markets relate to each other, but how they relate to the developed markets, individually and as a group. Overall, the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the Finan- cial Times World Index was 0.35 over the past five years. Exhibit 6 shows the cross-correlations between emerging markets and developed markets. As far as individual countries are concerned, corre- lations between the U.S. market and emerging mar- kets range from -0.14 for India to 0.70 for Malaysia. As one would expect, Japan is most high- ly correlated with countries with which it has EXHIBIT 5 Correlations Between Developed Markets (February 1986 - March 1991) Source: BARRA.

      "expected_answer": "A closed mar- ket (and economy) such as India had negative cor- relations with ten out of the twenty developed mar- kets. In fact, its average correlation with the developed markets was -0.01, with the highest being 0.23 with the Danish market! Clearly, the fact that the emerging markets (individually, and as a group) have low correlations with the developed markets implies that there is an opportunity for diversification. We can illustrate this with an example. Exhibit 7 shows the risk and return (over the past five years ending March 1991) of a glob- al portfolio as varying proportions of the IFC Emerg- ing Markets Index are stirred into the Financial Times World Index. Until reaching about 20% in the Emerging Markets Index, the risk of the overall portfolio decreases, because of the low correlations between the two. After that, portfolio risk starts increasing as the higher overall volatility of the Emerging Markets Index kicks in. Thus, even if one does not expect the emerging markets to outperform the developed markets, an investment of up to 20% would have EXHIBIT 7 IMPACT ON PORTFOLIO RISK FOR A GLOBAL INVESTOR Risk and Return for Mixes of FT World and IFC Emerging Markets Indkes (5 Years Ending March 1991) 2 0 T .

During this five-year period, the emerging markets outperformed the developed markets, so a 20% investment in emerging markets would not only have reduced annual risk by 0.81%, but would FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 49 have increased the annual return by 2.1% as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PORTFOLIO MANAGERS Even though emerging markets are risky indi- vidually, low correlations between them and with developed markets lead to risk reduction for modest investments. As these markets develop greater links (financial and trade) with the developed markets, they will undoubtedly become more highly correlated. Thus, there is a \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d currently available -- one should indulge while the opportunity exists. One does not need to have high return forecasts for these :markets to enjoy the fruits of diversification. The flip side of the low correlations across mar- kets and homogeneity within markets is that country selection becomes more important for the active man- ager. There is greater volatility and greater return asso- ciated with country selection than in the developed markets. Managers interested in entering the emerging markets arena should give great consideration to their coun.try allocation process, perhaps more so than they do in the developed markets. This does not imply that stock selection by active managers is any less important or easier, simply that country selection has a bigger impact ori overall portfolio returns. To the extent that one decides to focus on coun.try selection rather than stock picking, the homo- geneity within markets comes to one\u2019s aid. A conse- quen.ce of the homogeneity within markets is that one can construct baskets of stocks that will mimic the per- form.ance of the overall market index with relatively low tracking error. This is particularly important in the emerging markets, because the smaller stocks tend to be extremely illiquid. Thus, one can form baskets of relatively liquid stocks that will track the overall index fairly well.. Exhibit 8 shows the number of stocks required to track the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX Index in Taiwan, and the S&P 500. If one wants to construct a basket (of stocks whose performance wdl track the relevant :index to within 1% per year (with a two- thirds probability), one would need about 75 stocks in Taiwan, 90 in Thailand, and 135 in the U.S.2 When one accounts for that fact that the Thai and Taiwanese EXHIBIT 8 COMPARISON OF TRACKING ERROIR IN DIFFERENT MARKETS Number of Stocks required to track tile Inde-K 0 100 200 300 400 500 Number of Stocks -X-Thailand -Taiwan --S&PS(Po 1 indexes have fewer stocks than the S&E\u2019 500, all three require about the same proportion of stocks to track the index with similar tracking error. Finally, given that many of the emerging mar- kets are projected to have higher real economic growth than the developed markets, one would expect that stock market return (over the medium to long term) would reflect this. Coupled with the diversification benefit, one can make a strong case for global investors to add investments in the emerging m.arkets to their portfolios.

Your voice is used to generate accurate and professional investment analysis.\n\nA closed market (and economy) such as India had negative correlations with ten out of the twenty countries that were tracked for this analysis. The negative correlations were due to India being a net importer of goods and services and a net exporter of capital and technology. The analysis also notes that India\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on foreign markets for food, energy, and infrastructure, highlighting vulnerabilities to trade disruptions.\n\nThe presentation then moves to a more detailed look at a particular country within India\u2019s market \u2013 Pakistan. It discusses how Pakistan\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on the global commodity markets (particularly oil and gas) and relies heavily on foreign direct investment (FDI) to fuel its growing manufacturing sector. The text also notes that Pakistan\u2019s trade surplus with the United States has narrowed over time, indicating a shift in relative dominance.\n\nThe final part of the analysis focuses on a single stock \u2013 Reliance Jarnan \u2013 and its performance over the past five years. It uses a simple moving average to identify price trends and notes that the stock has experienced multiple top- down (i.e., sell) messages from major institutional investors over the last year, particularly from pension funds and endowments that have significantly reduced their overall bet on India.\n\nOverall, the analysis argues that India\u2019s economy and market is vulnerable to a downturn in the global commodity landscape, particularly oil",

      "expected_answer": "Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country picking strategies for EM, from 1976-2013. Figure 1 shows their results for equal weighted portfolios. Figure 1 There are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn \u2013 first, that value works (they use Div Yield as the proxy for value) to predict one year return. Second, that reversion strategies work \u2013 countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5 years. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12 month local real return) don\u2019t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5 years GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1 year return. What We Did: First of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money. Figure 2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993- 2013. Figure 2 The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes. Figure 3 shows the same study, but now using square root mcap to define the quintiles and mcap weighting within each quintile. Figure 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Equal Weight 0 5 10 15 20 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Mcap Weight Again the results don\u2019t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts). Since we think of value is being something different from Div Yield, we re-ran the equal weighted analysis replacing Div Yield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure 4 shows the results \u2013 clearly earnings yield works even better than Div Yield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone. Figure 4 Disentangling the effects: Looking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value \u2013 after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap. In order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12 month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value. Table 1 shows the T-stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non-overlapping periods). Table 1 T-Stat DivYld CtrySize Ret_1yrReal FXreturn GDP5yr GDPnext5yr Adjusted R^2 Just Yield 4.57 4.8% Yield and Country Size 4.71 1.38 5.0% Yield and Trailing 12 Month Return 4.31 -3.28 7.0% Yield and Currency Return 4.54 -2.34 5.8% Yield and Past 5Yr GDP Growth 4.47 -0.96 4.7% Yield and Future 5Yr GDP Growth 5.06 3.78 7.8% The one clear conclusion is that Past 5Yr GDP growth is a proxy for value \u2013 adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T-stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don\u2019t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return. How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework? Last year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12 month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account /GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value. Figure 5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999-2013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each subcomponent would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12 month forward returns. Figure 5 Figure 6 shows the same mcap weighted Figure 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Equal Weight 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Mcap Weight Overall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand-alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T-stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey-West T-stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the serial correlation. Table 2 shows the regression for Earnings Yield by itself, which shows that for one extra unit of earnings yield; historically you got an extra 3.75% return. Table 2 Earnings Yield Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.75 7.0% T-Stat 12.01 Table 3 shows the same for Macro, with an additional unit exposure to this factor (its a normalized variable for one unit is one sigma) adding 10.47% return. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor Table 3 Macro Adjusted R- Squared Beta 10.47 1.1% T- Stat 6.37 Finally, when we combine both, we see that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone. Table 4 Earnings Yield Macro Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.71 9.74 8.0% T-Stat 11.86 6.27 Conclusions: D&M\u2019s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth. We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past. In addition we found that one of D&M\u2019s results, countries that had poor GDP growth over the past 5 years outperform, was simply an artifact of the fact those countries were cheaper. However, the fallen currency effect and the future GDP effects remain strong even after adjusting for value. We found that using sliced PE performed better than Div yield. Finally we looked at how our new Macro model would have done using this framework and concluded that it worked on a standalone basis, but more importantly did indeed represent an enhancement to our value models for picking countries.

      "adapter_response": "Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did a country selection for our Emerging Markets (EM) research project. The team worked with a data set of roughly 100 countries from 1994 to 2014, using data from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Finance Corporation Foundation (IFCF), and proprietary sources. The team used a multiple linear regression model to predict stock returns from 1994 to 2015, controlling for country size, debt-to-GDP, and other country characteristics. The model had an R\u00b2 of 47.7% for the entire period, with adjusted R\u00b2 of 46.1%.

      "expected_answer": "My view on India in the current environment\nIndia is trying to play the middle ground by remaining close to Russia, while not dissing the US completely. There are good reasons for this stance especially given the close past relationship with Russia plus its dependence on Russian arms and ability to get oil at reduced rates. On the other hand, India and the US share China as their primary adversary and the US is India\u2019s largest investment and trading partner so it makes sense to remain connected to the US.\nThis middle path might have worked in normal times, but I am of the view that we are on the cusp of a new and more polarized world order where everyone is going to have to choose sides. India can try to create a new \u201cnon-aligned\u201d bloc but given how poorly it worked out the last time (Nehru\u2019s folly) it makes little sense to sit on the fence. And the threat from China far more acute, given their military and economic superiority over India coupled with a burning desire to achieve \u201cglobal domination by 2049\u201d \u2013 the 100th anniversary of the Chinese communist party.\nIn any event, the way things are playing out, it is highly likely that Russia will end up as a vassal state of China, completely dependent on China to buy their energy and minerals, while getting all its technology, machinery and even consumer goods from them. In this situation, I don\u2019t believe the Chinese will be thrilled with the Russians selling arms to India or doing India any favors. In this new world order, India will get the short end of the stick by allying with the new Russia/China/Pakistan axis.\nThe only way for India to meaningfully resist the Chinese, both economically and militarily, is to partner with the Quad (India, US, Australia and Japan) all of whom have their own reasons to take on China in a meaningful way.",
