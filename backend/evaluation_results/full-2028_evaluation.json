      "training_answer": "Recently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients whether the anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAt this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets, and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand.\n\nFor example, if we screen the MSCI World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50\u202f% of their sales from emerging markets, we find 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574\u202fbillion and make up only 2.1\u202f% of the market value of the MSCI World Index (see Exhibit\u202f6 for the ten largest companies in this group \u2013 not exactly the household names one expects to see).\n\nIn addition, locally\u2011domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home\u2011field advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well\u2011established local brands, government policies that tend to favour locals, and the fact that local competitors often have high profitability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share.\n\nA good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia would be extremely expensive. Moreover, they would face great difficulty competing against a well\u2011established player such as Magnit, which runs more than 4,000 stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20\u202f%. We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where it paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",

Investors are reacting: a large sovereign\u2011wealth fund reduced overall EM exposure; Texas Teachers Pension announced it will cut China weight in half; a large endowment is shifting China weight by investing in GMO EM ex\u2011China fund. The growing weight of China mirrors the Japan\u2011in\u2011EAFE issue of the 1980s.\n\nSlide 4 \u2013 Index weight\nChina + Taiwan represent 45.5% of the MSCI EM index; China alone is 31.0%. China A\u2011Shares are only 20% of their market value in the index; full inclusion would raise China A\u2011Shares from 5% to 22% of MSCI.\n\nSlide 5 \u2013 Country\u2011level concentration\nHerfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index (HHI) shows a very lopsided portfolio when China/Taiwan dominate the EM index.\n\nSlide 6 \u2013 Cap weighting positives\nMarket\u2011cap weighting aligns with liquidity. Example: Alvaro\u2019s fund grew from $3\u202fbn to $10\u202fbn under cap weighting.\n\nSlide 7 \u2013 Equal weighting trade\u2011offs\nEqual weighting solves concentration but creates other issues; the same Alvaro example is cited.\n\nSlide 8 \u2013 Square\u2011root cap weighting\nA compromise: square\u2011root market\u2011cap weighting balances liquidity and concentration concerns.\n\nSlide 9 \u2013 The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio concept\nNot an index \u2013 construction involves judgment. Ideal features: focus on country weights, cap\u2011weight stocks within each country for liquidity, intuitive \u201csmell test\u201d, smaller China/Taiwan exposure emerging naturally, no single country or tightly correlated group dominates, multiple risk and opportunity dimensions considered.\n\nSlide 10 \u2013 Factors to consider in the \u201cNew Normal\u201d\n\nSlide 11\u201113 \u2013 Demographics\nBigger populations are better, but labor\u2011market dynamics matter. China\u2019s one\u2011child policy led to a peak in 2010; its labor force is now shrinking. India\u2019s demographics will peak around 2030 with a still\u2011expanding labor force. Dependency ratios illustrate these trends.\n\nSlide 14\u201115 \u2013 Climate\nClimate risk is rising. It\u2019s not just vulnerability; it\u2019s also the ability to respond. Taiwan is vulnerable to sea\u2011level rise but can build sea walls; Bangladesh cannot. Company\u2011level resilience matters \u2013 e.g., Czech Republic\u2019s CEZ gets 30\u201140% of its power from coal.\n\nSlide 16\u201117 \u2013 Geopolitics\nGeopolitical risk is becoming more important but is hard to predict. New World Order risk makes export\u2011dependent economies vulnerable. China depends on the world for food and energy, whereas Brazil\u2019s dependence runs the opposite way.\n\nSlide 18 \u2013 Weighting the factors\nIt is an art, not a science \u2013 total weighting sums to 100%.\n\nSlide 19\u201122 \u2013 Country and sector metrics\nTop and bottom countries on the new\u2011normal metric are identified. The \u201cNew Normal\u201d reduces country concentration without affecting other dimensions. China and Taiwan together fall to about 20% of the portfolio.\n\nSlide 23\u201125 \u2013 Sector weights and concentration\nSector weights of the \u201cNew Normal\u201d resemble the MSCI benchmark. Herfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index drops from 0.16 (MSCI EM) to 0.08 (New EM), indicating much lower concentration.\n\nSlide 26 \u2013 How investors could use this\nFor broad EM exposure, an ETF tracking the \u201cNew Normal\u201d offers a better exposure. Active managers can use it as a custom benchmark for country\u2011level bets. The presenter invites feedback.\n\nSlide 27 \u2013 Summary\nEM is broken and needs re\u2011imagining. The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio is neither a traditional index nor an active portfolio but a new way of thinking about sensible EM investing. Multiple factors matter; combining them is an art, not a science. The resulting portfolio is comfortable for long\u2011term ownership with minimal turnover. Bottom line: the \u201cNew Normal\u201d is a better way to invest in EM.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first looked at \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group of stocks we follow quite closely is high\u2011quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today. GMO\u2019s experience suggests that markets systematically underprice quality. In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today.\n\nOver the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004.\n\nIn the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts.\n\nFinally, as in cou",
      "training_answer": "ntry selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other).\n\nOverall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\nWhen we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s 7\u2011year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset\u2011allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nThose of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar\u2011year\u2011end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to **grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on** for what could be a difficult ride.",

      "training_answer": "**Implications for Portfolio Managers**\n\nEven though individual emerging markets are risky, their low correlations with each other and with developed markets enable risk reduction for modest allocations. Figure\u202f7 (Exhibit\u202f7) illustrates the risk\u2011return trade\u2011off of mixing the IFC Emerging Markets Index with the FT World Index over the five\u2011year period ending March\u202f1991. Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest. As emerging markets develop stronger financial and trade links with the rest of the world, correlations are expected to increase, eroding this free lunch.\n\nBecause of the high within\u2011market homogeneity, active managers should focus on **country selection** rather than intensive stock picking. The larger impact of country selection is evident in the higher volatility and return dispersion across countries. Nevertheless, constructing low\u2011tracking\u2011error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuable, especially given the illiquidity of many small\u2011cap stocks. Exhibit\u202f8 shows that tracking the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX in Taiwan, and the S&P\u202f500 requires roughly 75, 90, and 135 stocks respectively to achieve a 1\u202f% tracking error with two\u2011thirds confidence.\n\nFinally, the authors note that many emerging economies are projected to sustain higher real economic growth than developed economies, suggesting that medium\u2011 to long\u2011term equity returns should reflect this advantage. Coupled with diversification benefits, the case for adding emerging\u2011market exposure to a global portfolio is compelling.\n\n**Endnotes & References**\n\nThe paper cites sources such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook\u202f1991,\u201d Brown\u202f(1991), Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f(1989), and Roll\u202f(1990). The authors conclude that while emerging markets present heightened volatility, the combination of low cross\u2011market correlations, high within\u2011market homogeneity, and superior growth prospects creates a unique risk\u2011return profile for global investors.\n\n*Key take\u2011aways*\n\n* Low correlations across emerging markets \u2192 diversification benefit.\n* High within\u2011market homogeneity \u2192 country selection matters more than stock picking.\n* Modest (\u224820\u202f%) emerging\u2011market allocation can reduce portfolio risk and boost return.\n* The \u201cfree lunch\u201d may diminish as markets become more integrated.\n* Constructing index\u2011tracking baskets is feasible with relatively few stocks due to homogeneity.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nEveryone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio\u2014through increased investments in emerging markets!\\n\\nModest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk\\nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January 1988 to December 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years\u2014it is true for any five\u2011year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created).\\n\\nThis analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well\u2011diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market\u2011capitalization weights, the right answer?\\n\\nCapitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions\\nThe case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries.\\n\\nIn the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient.\\n\\nIn such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is avail",
      "training_answer": "able to global investors.\\n\\nIf market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\\n\\nIf not market or GDP weights, then what?\\nAnother proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well\u2011understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum\u2011variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight.\\n\\nThe theoretical basis for such a low\u2011volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex\u2011ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex\u2011post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex\u2011ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex\u2011post minimum\u2011variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market\u2011weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex\u2011post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean\u2011variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio.\\n\\nThus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex\u2011ante forecast of the relative return of one vis\u2011a\u2011vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles. Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\\n\\nThis weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds).",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nWe have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global ri",
      "training_answer": "vals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",

As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 25\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the median for a poor country (e.g., Nigeria 39.5\u202f% of the U.S. CAGR, Brazil 23.4\u202f% of the U.S. CAGR), consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods.

With high oil prices, a reduced foreign debt load, and massive foreign exchange reserves, there are no dark clouds on the horizon. While recent economic growth has been extremely dependent on high oil prices, we have started to see the beginnings of a consumer society that could fuel growth for the next few years.\n\nLooking at the history of other authoritarian regimes, one sees that they tend to succeed in their early phases \u2013 what I call the Bill",

Well, not all of India, but an important part of it which depends on government policy action. The reason is the exposure of corruption and scandals associated with government officials taking bribes. \nCorruption has been endemic in India since the time of independence in 1947 (and maybe well before that as well). What\u2019s different this time is that the media have been exposing this corruption and on the back of these revelations important people (more specifically senior politicians and billionaires) are being put in jail and are being kept there, with judges refusing to grant them bail. \nIn the past, these same people would give and take bribes with impunity, secure in the knowledge that they were above scrutiny and prosecution and even if they were sent to jail, could live a 5 star luxury lifestyle while there, with home cooked meals, internet access, personal butlers and afternoon tea with the wardens. In the harsh light of intense media scrutiny, all that has changed. Things have got so bad that there\u2019s anecdotal evidence that industrialists are refusing to give bribes to politicians on the grounds that the politicians are not acting despite being bribed!!! \nThis is not the fear of an innocent person being unfairly accused, but of a guilty person being afraid being exposed.

      "training_answer": "Indy 500*. \nNow this may sound like a very positive change, and in fact, in the long run, it probably is. However, in the short run, it has had a chilling effect on all aspects of government action \u2013 no action is being taken on new projects, projects that have been approved are not being funded and even works in progress (like road construction) have halted as funds are not being disbursed. \nI have often made the argument that India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. However, India has a high need for government action in the arena of infrastructure, supply chains etc. and there\u2019s evidence that bottlenecks in the economy are creating a serious impediment to fast growth without inflationary pressure. In fact the Reserve Bank is so worried that it raised rates 50bps today and in effect told the government to get off its butt and deal with the bottlenecks -\n \u201cIt is important to recognize that in the absence of appropriate actions for addressing supply bottlenecks, especially in food and infrastructure, questions about the ability of the economy to sustain the current growth rate without significant inflationary pressures come to the fore. The economy's ability to grow rapidly for any length of time without provoking inflation is dependent on implementing policies, with corresponding resource allocations, which will allow the supply of various products and services to keep pace with demand.\u201d\n* Reference from the movie Apocalypse Now",

In short, either you go along with our program or we\u2019ll do it for you.\n\nFinally, jailing Mr. Khodorkovsky is a clear warning to other oligarchs and business leaders that they should steer clear of politics and contemplate sublimating their political desires into ownership of sports franchises outside Russia. The San Francisco 49ers could certainly use a deep\u2011pocketed owner. Yo! Potanin, over here!\n\nIn short, Mr. Putin intends to have complete control of all levels of political and economic activity. It is telling that the only dissenting voice to speak up is that of his own maverick economic advisor Andrei Illarionov who said, \u201cThe sale of Yuganskneftegaz to a mystical, and now not so mystical, company named Baikal Finance Group has won this year\u2019s \u2018shady deal\u2019 of the year award.\u201d While Mr. Putin has ignored the free\u2011speaking Illarionov\u2019s inflammatory comments in the past, it will be interesting to see how he will react to this outburst.\n\nIf Mr. Putin succeeds in creating this new paradigm of government\u2011sponsored capitalism (and I believe that in the short run, he very well might), my fear is that he will create a new model for development that will be detrimental to minority shareholders such as ourselves, not just in Russia, but elsewhere as well.\n\nSo will he succeed? With high oil prices, a reduced foreign debt load, and massive foreign exchange reserves, there are no dark clouds on the horizon. While recent economic growth has been extremely dependent on high oil prices, we have started to see the beginnings of a consumer society that could fuel growth for the next few years.\n\nLooking at the history of other authoritarian regimes, one sees that they tend to succeed in their early phases \u2013 what I call the Bill Parcells\u00b9 effect \u2013 that intimidation does \u2026\n\nEleven years ago, GMO\u2019s Annual Client Conference (soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union), I said I believed we were living in a golden age of capitalism. With communism and socialism having been so thoroughly and comprehensively discredited, there was only one competing paradigm for economic development \u2013 that of free and open markets and privatization of government owned companies, rather than nationalization and central planning. It was based on this shift that I made my long\u2011term case for investing in emerging markets (although from a short\u2011term point of view, October 1993 did not represent particularly good timing on my part).\n\nI also said that I did not believe that this golden age would last forever, that former socialists/authoritarians had not suddenly turned into committed free\u2011traders, but were biding their time and would surely make a re\u2011appearance some day, selling the same old vodka in new bottles.\n\nThat day may now have arrived in Russia.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Putin is trying to create a model of the modern authoritarian state where private corporations and government owned/controlled entities both serve some greater \u201cnational good\u201d in addition to attempting to enrich their shareholders.\n\nThe Yukos case serves as a multi\u2011pronged attempt in attaining this goal. On one hand, it is perhaps the first step in reversing some of the privatizations of the early 90s and to establish a \u201cnational energy company\u201d \u2013 a government controlled energy giant that would play in the same league as OPEC. While economic reasons play a role, the primary motivation is to serve Russia\u2019s geopolitical goals. In a post 9/11 world of energy insecurity, Russia\u2019s energy assets have more strategic clout than their nuclear missiles.\n\nAnother aspect is to send a very clear signal to Mr. Khodorkovsky and his fellow oligarchs that companies \u2026",

He must be very happy, and I\u2019m sure he is, given how well he handled the sanctions.\n\nWhile Mr. Khodorkovsky is being heavily criticized, and many of his fellow officials are being put in jail, it is important to note that he is not a criminal. In fact, he has made many non- criminal arrests without prior evidence being presented to prove his criminal nature. One can see Mr. Khodorkovsky as a typical criminal, trying to understand how he could be sent to jail, how he could get out of its control, and what they might do to him.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important is to see how he is being treated by the people and what he is being allowed to do on his behalf.

He is extremely plugged in with the financial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefit. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions.\n\nIn my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and financial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long\u2011term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital?\n\nOne of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by Edward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high\u2011speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure financial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high\u2011speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high\u2011speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high\u2011speed rail in expansive continental geographies.\n\nIn short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have difficult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years).\n\nThe one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government actually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song). As you may guess, none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profits by investing in telecoms outside of India. This",
      "training_answer": "is what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high profits because producers benefitted from shortages.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of bad policy\u2011making (India consistently runs high budget deficits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high\u2011return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefits investors by delivering high return on investment.\n\nNow this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India benefits from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high\u2011cost\u2011of\u2011capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth.\n\nI believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to grow. We already see inflation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High inflation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high\u2011inflation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs.\n\nNevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom\u2011up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state\u2011directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profit\u2011maximizers.\n\nIn the final analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profitability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t focus on growth. Focus on profitability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation \u2013 we are willing to pay a premium for profitability, but not to overpay for it.\n\nCurrent positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring inflation down, a task that is made much harder by the proliferate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of Arjun Divecha and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nIn 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF).\n\nI have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, \u201cThe four most dangerous words in the English language are \u2013 This Time it\u2019s Different\u201d. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that\u2019s why we got it wrong.\n\nWe manage EMF with a focus on the top down \u2013 our view is (and has been for the entire 28\u2011year period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60\u201170% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors.\n\nWe do this in a primarily quantitative fashion \u2013 using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions \u2013 value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance.\n\nThis strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and it remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies.\n\nWith that as background, let\u2019s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis.\n\nRussia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation.\n\nSo then the question became \u2013 in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether?\n\nAlas, we did not.\n\nWhat was our thinking behind this?\n\nWe believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all\u2011out assault on the entire cou",
      "training_answer": "ntry, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, a 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes.\n\nBut even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about\u2011face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well.\n\nThe issues in our minds are \u2013 what could/should we have done differently?\n\nFirst of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black\u2011swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex\u2011ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Let\u2019s assume that I\u2019m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be devoted to protecting against black\u2011swan events, i.e., how much tail\u2011risk insurance should you buy?\n\nThe answer I come to is the same I did prior to this \u2013 very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions.\n\nThe next question is did we right\u2011size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide \u2013 our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not led to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8\u20119%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin\u2019s eyes\u2026\n\nChina / Taiwan beckons\u2026",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\n\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, Chart\u202f2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time relative to the index. Historically value stocks trade at a 40\u202f% discount to the index; today they sit at a 34\u202f% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the fifteen\u2011year history for which we have data. The discount fell from a 46\u202f% discount in October\u202f2000 to the current 34\u202f% discount, a period during which value massively out\u2011performed.\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value behaves when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing. If value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Small\u2011cap stocks are the next logical place to look because smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness. Chart\u202f3 shows that the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32\u202f% in October\u202f2000 to just 12\u202f% today. This contraction in both value and small\u2011cap spreads occurred because both segments performed extremely well over the past four years, greatly helping our performance.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first examined \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks \u2013 companies forecast to have the highest earnings growth over the next two years. As expected, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but Chart\u202f4 shows they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group we follow closely is high\u2011quality stocks (Chart\u202f5). In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory would suggest. In emerging markets, quality stocks usually trade at a modest 9\u202f% premium to the market. Right now we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market.\n\nOver the past two years we have been developing a new measure of value that incorporates quality, and we had planned to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model with a \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. Given the current positioning of both",
      "training_answer": "value and quality, we began transitioning to the new model in May\u202f2004.\n\nIn the new model we explicitly adjust a stock\u2019s attractiveness for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio will rise as quality becomes relatively cheap, while the bet on what might be called \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks will fall. It also increases the average size of companies we own \u2013 a welcome change now that small caps are no longer attractive.\n\nOverall, 70\u202f% of our stock\u2011selection process remains value\u2011driven and 30\u202f% momentum\u2011driven. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value; that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\n\nWhen we say our ability to add value is diminished, the appropriate response is not to abandon emerging markets. Valuations for the asset class suggest emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall exposure if you are overweight the asset class, but emerging equities remain among the most attractive asset classes based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s seven\u2011year forecast, and GMO is heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to move money to another emerging manager. However, the contraction of value has not created greater opportunities elsewhere, so switching styles would not be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nClients who have been with us have enjoyed the value and small\u2011cap rally. While we aim to deliver out\u2011performance of about 4\u202f% per year, the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark by 13.1\u202f% in calendar\u2011year\u2011end\u202f2003, after out\u2011performing by 4.7\u202f% in 2002 and 8.1\u202f% in 2001. If the compression of value leads to tougher times in the next couple of years, at least you have already reaped the benefits of that compression.\n\nWe are battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride.",
