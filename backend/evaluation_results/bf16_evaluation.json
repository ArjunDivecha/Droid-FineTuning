      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nArjun Divecha\n\nOver the last 4 years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deli",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",
      "model_response": "\u2026 (Please provide a detailed analysis)mPid\nE. 0\n0\nof 10 x\n}>\nFrom a macro\u2011economics point of view, cheap countries tend to be driven largely by weak economic growth within the country. As a result, they tend to be driven by countries where the central bank is weak or has just got started\u00a0uppression\u00a0of money\u00a0supply\u00a0(e.g.,\u00a0India\u00a0and\u00a0Pakistan).

In game theory, the protagonist or \u201cplayer\u201d tries to outsmart its opponent by choosing a strategy that leads to maximum gain for itself. The opponent, on the other hand, tries to think up a strategy that will lead to maximum loss for itself. The player then determines if its strategy makes sense, i.e., if it is likely to work, and if so, decides to implement it. The opponent, on the other hand, decides whether or not to play by these same rules and assumptions.\nThe framework that game theory provides you with to analyze your market is based on the assumption that players (or companies) are rational and try to maximize their own interests. They act, therefore, with \u201cmaximally aware\u201d of their opportunities and costs. In other words, they think and act in self interest. \nIn short, game theory is all about using logic and probability to predict the possible outcomes of a game. The player then decides what strategy should be used to get the advantage. The strategy should take into account the strategies of their opponent and should be based on the analysis of the game. The potential gains and losses of the player should then be determined and a strategy should be selected that will allow you to commit to a maximum no of units being purchased.\nNow this sounds a lot",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nWe have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global rivals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",
      "model_response": "(Please provide a detailed analysis) \uac81actly about the market trends that shape up in emerging markets, we\u2019ve been working on a regular basis. As an investment professional who has been with EMF for 18 years, we have noticed that emerging markets are evolving into more attractive options for large-scale investors looking for opportunity at the right time. This market is not already known to mainstream investors and so, if done right, it has the potential of being huge.\n\nOne of the key factors contributing to the evolution of emerging markets over the last 18 years is directionality. In past years, we have seen a clear divide: countries that were already developed markets had no alternative but to go all in and become full-fledged developed markets. Now, however, there are countries that have already become developed markets (with high tariffs) at a young age (e.g., China, India) at which point it makes little sense to invest your money in those countries. \n\nMoreover, emerging markets are starting to move away from being simple, target-diversified investments.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nHow Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework?\nLast year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top\u2011down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean\u2011reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12\u2011month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account/GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money\u2011supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value.\n\nFigure\u202f5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999\u20112013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each sub\u2011component would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12\u2011month forward returns.\n\nFigure\u202f6 shows the same m\u2011cap weighted results.\n\nOverall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand\u2011alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly fr",

In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey\u2011West T\u2011stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the serial correlation.\n\nTable\u202f2 \u2013 Earnings Yield alone:\nBeta = 3.75, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 7.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 12.01.\n\nTable\u202f3 \u2013 Macro alone (normalized to one sigma):\nBeta = 10.47, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 1.1\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 6.37. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor.\n\nTable\u202f4 \u2013 Combined model:\nEarnings Yield Beta = 3.71, Macro Beta = 9.74, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 8.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stats = 11.86 (Earnings Yield) and 6.27 (Macro).\n\nThe combined regression shows that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone.\n\nConclusions:\n\u2022 D&M\u2019s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth.\n\u2022 We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past.\n\u2022 The finding that countries with poor GDP growth over the past 5\u202fyears outperform was simply an artifact of those countries being cheaper; the fallen\u2011currency effect and the future\u2011GDP effect remain strong after adjusting for value.\n\u2022 Using sliced PE performed better than dividend yield.\n\u2022 Our new macro model works on a stand\u2011alone basis and, more importantly, represents a genuine enhancement to our value\u2011based country\u2011picking process.\n\nEvelyn Huang\nArjun Divecha\n\nINTERNAL ONLY: Not for external distribution",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nIn 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF).\n\nI have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, \u201cThe four most dangerous words in the English language are \u2013 This Time it\u2019s Different\u201d. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that\u2019s why we got it wrong.\n\nWe manage EMF with a focus on the top down \u2013 our view is (and has been for the entire 28\u2011year period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60\u201170% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors.\n\nWe do this in a primarily quantitative fashion \u2013 using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions \u2013 value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance.\n\nThis strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and it remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies.\n\nWith that as background, let\u2019s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis.\n\nRussia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation.\n\nSo then the question became \u2013 in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether?\n\nAlas, we did not.\n\nWhat was our thinking behind this?\n\nWe believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all\u2011out assault on the entire cou",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nntry, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, a 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes.\n\nBut even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about\u2011face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well.\n\nThe issues in our minds are \u2013 what could/should we have done differently?\n\nFirst of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black\u2011swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex\u2011ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Let\u2019s assume that I\u2019m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be devoted to protecting against black\u2011swan events, i.e., how much tail\u2011risk insurance should you buy?\n\nThe answer I come to is the same I did prior to this \u2013 very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions.\n\nThe next question is did we right\u2011size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide \u2013 our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not led to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8\u20119%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin\u2019s eyes\u2026\n\nChina / Taiwan beckons\u2026",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nEveryone knows that investing in emerging markets is risky. That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" we show that investment in a well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio of up to 50% would have reduced the overall volatility of a global investor's portfolio over the past five years. In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio\u2014through increased investments in emerging markets!\\n\\nModest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk\\nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January 1988 to December 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years\u2014it is true for any five\u2011year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created).\\n\\nThis analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well\u2011diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market\u2011capitalization weights, the right answer?\\n\\nCapitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions\\nThe case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries.\\n\\nIn the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient.\\n\\nIn such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is available to global investors.\\n\\nIf market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\\n\\nIf not market or GDP weights, then what?\\nAnother proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well\u2011understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum\u2011variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight.\\n\\nThe theoretical basis for such a low\u2011volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex\u2011ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex\u2011post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex\u2011ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex\u2011post minimum\u2011variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market\u2011weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex\u2011post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean\u2011variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio.\\n\\nThus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex\u2011ante forecast of the relative return of one vis\u2011a\u2011vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles. Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\\n\\nThis weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds).",

Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5\u202fyears GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1\u202fyear return.\n\nWhat We Did:\nFirst of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money.\n\nFigure\u202f2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993\u20112013. The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes.\n\nFigure\u202f3 shows the same study, but now using square\u2011root market\u2011cap to define the quintiles and market\u2011cap weighting within each quintile. Again the results don\u2019t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts).\n\nSince we think of value as being something different from Div\u202fYield, we re\u2011ran the equal\u2011weighted analysis replacing Div\u202fYield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure\u202f4 shows the results \u2013 clearly earnings yield works even better than Div\u202fYield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone.\n\nDisentangling the effects:\nLooking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value \u2013 after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap.\n\nIn order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12\u2011month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value.\n\nTable\u202f1 shows the T\u2011stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non\u2011overlapping periods).\n\n| Variable | T\u2011Stat | Adjusted R\u00b2 |\n|---|---|---|\n| DivYld | 4.57 | 4.8% |\n| Yield and Country Size | 4.71 | 1.38 |\n| Yield and Trailing 12\u202fMonth Return | 4.31 | \u20133.28 |\n| Yield and Currency Return | 4.54 | \u20132.34 |\n| Yield and Past 5\u202fYr GDP Growth | 4.47 | \u20130.96 |\n| Yield and Future 5\u202fYr GDP Growth | 5.06 | 3.78 |\n\nThe one clear conclusion is that Past 5\u202fYr GDP growth is a proxy for value \u2013 adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T\u2011stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don\u2019t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nOver the last four years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets \u2013 both cheap countries and cheap stocks. As a result, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks have narrowed. Because we are primarily value investors, that narrowing would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\n\nChart\u202f1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive ones. In normal times cheap countries trade at 78\u202f% of the valuation of expensive countries \u2013 a 22\u202f% discount. Right now that discount has narrowed to 15\u202f%. Does that mean cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount two years ago and value worked very well for country selection since then. By contrast, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (the latter half of the Asian crisis) cheap countries suffered their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next twelve months.\n\nWhat this means, in our view, is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nIt?**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (45\u202f% weight in our country\u2011assessment model), it is not the only metric we use. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form the remaining 55\u202f% and we have no evidence that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. Our work on currency vulnerability also shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking\u2011error of around 8\u202f%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking the tracking\u2011error down from 8\u202f% to about 6\u202f%. Consequently, our current overweight of Brazil will fall from 9.5\u202f% to roughly 7\u202f%, with similar adjustments across all country positions.\n\nThese actions reflect a shift from pure value\u2011driven country bets to a more balanced approach that still respects the 45\u202f% value component but gives greater weight to momentum, macro and judgment. The overall intent is to protect the portfolio from the heightened risk that the narrowing spread now represents while preserving the upside that still exists in cheap\u2011country exposure.",
      "model_response": "It?**\n\nThe first step is to identify the countries that are both cheap and having the opportunity to learn from the experience of other, more expensive countries. According to EM\u00a0500, as of 12\u202f/12\u202f/12\u202fR\u00a0E, there are 125 countries that are both cheap and have the potential of having learned from the experience of more expensive countries.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first looked at \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group of stocks we follow quite closely is high\u2011quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today. GMO\u2019s experience suggests that markets systematically underprice quality. In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today.\n\nOver the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model for stock picking with a new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004.\n\nIn the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts.\n\nFinally, as in cou",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nntry selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other).\n\nOverall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we\u2019ll sleep much easier.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\nWhen we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s 7\u2011year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset\u2011allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nThose of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar\u2011year\u2011end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way.\n\nWe\u2019re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to **grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on** for what could be a difficult ride.",

However, in my opinion, the secret to his success has been fear and intimidation, which works in the short run, but is ultimately counter\u2011productive \u2013 as evidenced by his having to move to a new team every few years.\n\n2\ndecisions about how we invest your money. As I said in my Emerging Thoughts piece on Mr. Putin\u2019s early days in July 2000 (\u201cPutin on the Ritz\u201d), \u201cAs fund managers, we need to be able to distinguish the unpalatable from the unprofitable.\u201d\n\nSo, what are we doing about this situation? Our country selection process has four elements \u2013 three based on objective, quantitative data and one based on our judgment, which represents 10% of the overall assessment of a country.\n\nCurrently, the quantitative parts of the model are quite negative on Russia, with a combined score of -0.9 (which is quite negative). While the market is relatively cheap (based on high oil company profits) our momentum and macroeconomic models are quite negative. This negative score translates into a moderately large underweighting relative to the benchmark.\n\nGiven the risks I\u2019ve talked about, it makes sense that we should have a negative judgment on Russia. If we were to assess a score of -1.0 on our judgment, the overall score for Russia would fall to -1.2 and our underweighting would increase by 1/2 a percent.\n\nWere the quantitative parts of the model to turn positive over the coming months, we would increase our weight in Russia, recognizing that our judgment serves as a drag on how much we buy, but does not override it.\n\nWould we override the entire process and get out of Russia altogether? Yes, in an extreme circumstance. However, these kinds of systemic overrides are few and far between. The last time we chose to get out a country altogether was when we sold all of our Pakistani holdings when the central bank stealthily imposed capital controls in 2001.\n\nWhile events in Russia are causing angst and forcing us to watch the situation very carefully, we are not yet close to having to take extreme measures. It\u2019s time to be afraid, but not very afraid.\n\nauthoritarian regimes tend to fail in the medium to longer term for a very simple reason \u2013 every petty official from the president on down acquires the ability to be capricious or corrupt without fear of consequences, and frequently chooses to use that power to further their own personal interests. We saw proof of this concept in late December when a senior official within the telecommunication ministry tried (but ultimately failed) to levy punitive back taxes on the cellular carrier Vimplecom. It turns out that this official is affiliated with a major shareholder of one of Vimplecom\u2019s competitors.\n\nHowever, internal affairs within Russia are not the only cause for concern. Recent events in Ukraine also raise the prospect that Russia is on a collision course with the West over what it sees as encroachment onto its home turf.\n\nHaving owned and backed the wrong candidate in the recent election, Mr. Putin may be behind by a couple of goals, but make no mistake, it\u2019s only the first period in a game that has no ending. And, if the sordid history of Yukos is any guide, Mr. Putin is not a leader lightly scorned. Given that Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its natural gas (a number that will rise, not fall, in coming years) and that 80% of that gas transits through Ukraine, Russia holds a number of very significant cards in this game. One can see Mr. Putin using these cards to pull Ukraine back into the Russian fold \u2013 which will exacerbate tensions with the West.\n\nFinally, Russia has started to make overtures to China, India, and Iran \u2013 offering them a stake in future energy ventures along with advanced military weaponry, with the explicit goal of driving a wedge between them and the US.\n\nAll these factors increase risks for Western minority investors in Russia.\n\nWhile this kind of speculation makes for good cocktail party chatter, we are in the position of having to make\nGMO Emerging Thoughts\nThe Empire Strikes Back, January 2005",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nIn 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF).\n\nI have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, \u201cThe four most dangerous words in the English language are \u2013 This Time it\u2019s Different\u201d. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that\u2019s why we got it wrong.\n\nWe manage EMF with a focus on the top down \u2013 our view is (and has been for the entire 28\u2011year period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60\u201170% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors.\n\nWe do this in a primarily quantitative fashion \u2013 using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions \u2013 value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance.\n\nThis strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and it remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies.\n\nWith that as background, let\u2019s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis.\n\nRussia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation.\n\nSo then the question became \u2013 in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether?\n\nAlas, we did not.\n\nWhat was our thinking behind this?\n\nWe believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all\u2011out assault on the entire country, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, a 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes.\n\nBut even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about\u2011face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well.\n\nThe issues in our minds are \u2013 what could/should we have done differently?\n\nFirst of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black\u2011swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex\u2011ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Let\u2019s assume that I\u2019m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be devoted to protecting against black\u2011swan events, i.e., how much tail\u2011risk insurance should you buy?\n\nThe answer I come to is the same I did prior to this \u2013 very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions.\n\nThe next question is did we right\u2011size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide \u2013 our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not led to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8\u20119%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin\u2019s eyes\u2026\n\nChina / Taiwan beckons\u2026",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nHow Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework?\nLast year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top\u2011down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean\u2011reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12\u2011month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account/GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money\u2011supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value.\n\nFigure\u202f5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999\u20112013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each sub\u2011component would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12\u2011month forward returns.\n\nFigure\u202f6 shows the same m\u2011cap weighted results.\n\nOverall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand\u2011alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T\u2011stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey\u2011West T\u2011stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the serial correlation.\n\nTable\u202f2 \u2013 Earnings Yield alone:\nBeta = 3.75, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 7.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 12.01.\n\nTable\u202f3 \u2013 Macro alone (normalized to one sigma):\nBeta = 10.47, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 1.1\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 6.37. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor.\n\nTable\u202f4 \u2013 Combined model:\nEarnings Yield Beta = 3.71, Macro Beta = 9.74, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 8.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stats = 11.86 (Earnings Yield) and 6.27 (Macro).\n\nThe combined regression shows that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone.\n\nConclusions:\n\u2022 D&M\u2019s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth.\n\u2022 We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past.\n\u2022 The finding that countries with poor GDP growth over the past 5\u202fyears outperform was simply an artifact of those countries being cheaper; the fallen\u2011currency effect and the future\u2011GDP effect remain strong after adjusting for value.\n\u2022 Using sliced PE performed better than dividend yield.\n\u2022 Our new macro model works on a stand\u2011alone basis and, more importantly, represents a genuine enhancement to our value\u2011based country\u2011picking process.\n\nEvelyn Huang\nArjun Divecha\n\nINTERNAL ONLY: Not for external distribution",

There are good reasons for this stance especially given the close past relationship with Russia plus its dependence on Russian arms and ability to get oil at reduced rates. On the other hand, India and the US share China as their primary adversary and the US is India\u2019s largest investment and trading partner so it makes sense to remain connected to the US.\n\nThis middle path might have worked in normal times, but I am of the view that we are on the cusp of a new and more polarized world order where everyone is going to have to choose sides. India can try to create a new \u201cnon-aligned\u201d bloc but given how poorly it worked out the last time (Nehru\u2019s folly) it makes little sense to sit on the fence. And the threat from China far more acute, given their military and economic superiority over India coupled with a burning desire to achieve \u201cglobal domination by 2049\u201d \u2013 the 100th anniversary of the Chinese communist party.\n\nIn any event, the way things are playing out, it is highly likely that Russia will end up as a vassal state of China, completely dependent on China to buy their energy and minerals, while getting all its technology, machinery and even consumer goods from them. In this situation, I don\u2019t believe the Chinese will be thrilled with the Russians selling arms to India or doing India any favors. In this new world order, India will get the short end of the stick by allying with the new Russia/China/Pakistan axis.\n\nThe only way for India to meaningfully resist the Chinese, both economically and militarily, is to partner with the Quad (India, US, Australia and Japan) all of whom have their own reasons to take on China in a meaningful way.",

The presentation opens with a metaphorical title, \u201cReading the Xi Leaves,\u201d signalling that the upcoming analysis will interpret President Xi\u2019s policy signals much like a reader deciphers the subtle patterns in tea leaves. The agenda quickly moves to a historical overview of China\u2019s \u201cprincipal contradiction\u201d \u2013 a concept first mentioned by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and formally codified by the Party in 1981. A timeline of contradictions (1948: capitalism vs. socialism; 1956: economic and cultural growth lagging demand; 1958: ideological struggle; 1981: material and cultural needs vs. backward production; 2017: imbalanced development vs. people\u2019s growing desire for a better life) illustrates how the Party\u2019s focus has shifted from pure growth to a more nuanced balance of quality, equity, and strategic security. \n\nThe \u201cChinese Dream\u201d \u2013 national rejuvenation \u2013 is framed as a tantalisingly reachable goal, illustrated with a chart showing China\u2019s GDP as a share of the United States rising from near\u2011zero in the 1980s to roughly 70\u202f% by 2021. Yet the presenter warns that a policy shift is required to sustain this ascent. Xi\u2019s 2017 speech is quoted: \u201cWhat we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people\u2019s ever\u2011growing needs for a better life.\u201d This sets up three strategic objectives: (1) Reduce inequality \u2013 China\u2019s Gini\u2011type inequality is among the world\u2019s highest; (2) Address the demographic time\u2011bomb \u2013 a rapidly ageing population; (3) Prioritise strategic industries \u2013 technology, batteries, semiconductors, and automation to secure supply chains and achieve self\u2011sufficiency. \n\nThe slides then drill into each objective.

For demographics, the analysis shows a 2\u202f% annual growth drag from a declining labour force, backed by IMF and Wind data, and presents a stark forecast: births fell to 12\u202fmillion in 2020 (47\u202f% of the 1987 peak) and could dip to 5\u202fmillion by 2040. A bar chart of factors influencing child\u2011bearing (education cost, housing price, medical expenses, etc.) underscores the social pressures. \n\nStrategic industry priorities are illustrated with a simple table of sectors (batteries, EVs, semiconductors, automation) and the \u201cuseless\u201d activities the Party may curb (gaming, short\u2011video). The presenter then uses a vivid analogy \u2013 \u201cThe Party Giveth and the Party Taketh Away\u201d \u2013 to question whether current market leaders (e.g., China Mobile) will survive regulatory swings. A line chart of China Mobile\u2019s ROE from 2000\u20112020, paired with a commentary excerpt, demonstrates how state\u2011driven regulation can rapidly reshape fortunes. \n\nRegulation and state support are portrayed as a double\u2011edged sword: massive gains for favoured sectors, severe losses for those that fall out of favour. The presenter\u2019s personal voice appears in a reminder: \u201cNever forget my first rule of EM investing.\u201d The slide deck concludes this section with a framework for evaluating sectors against the Chinese Dream\u2019s pillars (social impact, security, state control, etc.), scoring examples such as auto\u2011EV (+1 on most dimensions) versus e\u2011commerce (\u20114).

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**A Model to Understand Risk and Return**\n\nTo analyze risk and return, the authors develop a multi\u2011factor model similar to that used for developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f[1989]). The model hierarchically decomposes portfolio excess return (return beyond the risk\u2011free rate) into currency return, local excess return, and a cross\u2011product term. Equation\u202f(1) expresses excess numeraire return as:\n\n    Excess Numeraire Return = (Currency Return) \u2013 (Local Excess Return) + (Cross\u2011Product)\n\nwhere the currency return captures exchange\u2011rate effects and interest\u2011rate differentials, the local excess return reflects the asset\u2019s performance in its home market, and the cross\u2011product term (r_c \u00d7 r_l) is usually small and can be ignored for most markets. However, for Argentina and Brazil the cross\u2011product is material (changing annual risk by 17\u202f% and 4\u202f% respectively), so the authors model these assets directly in U.S. dollars rather than decomposing them.\n\nLocal excess return is further broken into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk\u2011index return (size, earnings\u2011to\u2011price, liquidity, etc.). Exposures to country factors are measured by betas to the market of each country; industry exposures use the Financial Times World\u2011Wide (FTWW) classification; risk\u2011index exposures are normalized within each country.\n\nThe model was estimated for assets from 23 emerging markets (February\u202f1986\u202f\u2013\u202fJuly\u202f1991) using data from the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources. The adjusted R\u00b2 for the full emerging\u2011markets model is 50\u202f%, compared with 38\u202f% for a comparable developed\u2011markets model. Two sub\u2011models help explain this difference:\n\n1. **Industry\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Industry Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 16\u202f% for emerging markets versus 22\u202f% for developed markets, indicating weaker cross\u2011country industry integration in emerging markets.\n\n2. **Country\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 46\u202f% for emerging markets versus 30\u202f% for developed markets, showing that country\u2011specific forces dominate emerging\u2011market returns.\n\n**Homogeneity within markets**\n\nThe large cou",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nntry\u2011factor contribution implies that stock returns within a given emerging market are more homogeneous than in developed markets. Even when stocks are equally weighted, the R\u00b2 remains high (42\u202f% vs. 29\u202f% for developed markets). The authors explore three possible explanations:\n\n* **Concentration effect** \u2013 a few large stocks dominate market capitalization.\n* **True homogeneity** \u2013 stocks move together regardless of size.\n* **Volatility\u2011driven R\u00b2** \u2013 higher market volatility inflates the explanatory power of the market factor.\n\nExhibit\u202f3 shows that most emerging markets are indeed more concentrated than developed markets, but the difference is modest. Asset\u2011concentration scores (a measure ranging from 0 for perfectly equal weights to 1 for total concentration) average around 0.13 for the larger emerging markets, compared with 0.08 for the U.S. market. Sector\u2011concentration scores are similarly modest; only a few small markets (e.g., Jordan, Nigeria) exhibit high sector concentration.\n\nWhen concentration is controlled for, the average unweighted correlation of monthly stock returns within each market remains higher for emerging markets (e.g., Taiwan 0.77, Brazil 0.70) than for developed markets (U.S. 0.49, Japan 0.46). This suggests a dominant market\u2011wide force that overwhelms industry differentials.\n\n**Heterogeneity across markets**\n\nIn contrast, emerging markets are weakly correlated with each other. Exhibit\u202f4 reports average pairwise correlations of only 0.07 over the five\u2011year sample, with many negative pairings (89 of 276 correlations are negative). The authors attribute this to limited trade links and restrictive foreign\u2011participation rules that insulated markets from one another. As globalization progresses, they expect these correlations to rise.\n\nBy comparison, developed markets exhibit an average correlation of 0.49 (Exhibit\u202f5), and the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the FT World Index is 0.35.\n\nThese findings have direct portfolio implications: low cross\u2011market correlations provide diversification benefits, while high within\u2011market homogeneity means that country selection, rather than stock picking, drives active returns in emerging markets.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nOver the last four years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets \u2013 both cheap countries and cheap stocks. As a result, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks have narrowed. Because we are primarily value investors, that narrowing would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\n\nChart\u202f1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive ones. In normal times cheap countries trade at 78\u202f% of the valuation of expensive countries \u2013 a 22\u202f% discount. Right now that discount has narrowed to 15\u202f%. Does that mean cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount two years ago and value worked very well for country selection since then. By contrast, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (the latter half of the Asian crisis) cheap countries suffered their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next twelve months.\n\nWhat this means, in our view, is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (45\u202f% weight in our country\u2011assessment model), it is not the only metric we use. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form the remaining 55\u202f% and we have no evidence that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. Our work on currency vulnerability also shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking\u2011error of around 8\u202f%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking the tracking\u2011error down from 8\u202f% to about 6\u202f%. Consequently, our current overweight of Brazil will fall from 9.5\u202f% to roughly 7\u202f%, with similar adjustments across all country positions.\n\nThese actions reflect a shift from pure value\u2011driven country bets to a more balanced approach that still respects the 45\u202f% value component but gives greater weight to momentum, macro and judgment. The overall intent is to protect the portfolio from the heightened risk that the narrowing spread now represents while preserving the upside that still exists in cheap\u2011country exposure.",

Investors are reacting: a large sovereign\u2011wealth fund reduced overall EM exposure; Texas Teachers Pension announced it will cut China weight in half; a large endowment is shifting China weight by investing in GMO EM ex\u2011China fund. The growing weight of China mirrors the Japan\u2011in\u2011EAFE issue of the 1980s.\n\nSlide 4 \u2013 Index weight\nChina + Taiwan represent 45.5% of the MSCI EM index; China alone is 31.0%. China A\u2011Shares are only 20% of their market value in the index; full inclusion would raise China A\u2011Shares from 5% to 22% of MSCI.\n\nSlide 5 \u2013 Country\u2011level concentration\nHerfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index (HHI) shows a very lopsided portfolio when China/Taiwan dominate the EM index.\n\nSlide 6 \u2013 Cap weighting positives\nMarket\u2011cap weighting aligns with liquidity. Example: Alvaro\u2019s fund grew from $3\u202fbn to $10\u202fbn under cap weighting.\n\nSlide 7 \u2013 Equal weighting trade\u2011offs\nEqual weighting solves concentration but creates other issues; the same Alvaro example is cited.\n\nSlide 8 \u2013 Square\u2011root cap weighting\nA compromise: square\u2011root market\u2011cap weighting balances liquidity and concentration concerns.\n\nSlide 9 \u2013 The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio concept\nNot an index \u2013 construction involves judgment. Ideal features: focus on country weights, cap\u2011weight stocks within each country for liquidity, intuitive \u201csmell test\u201d, smaller China/Taiwan exposure emerging naturally, no single country or tightly correlated group dominates, multiple risk and opportunity dimensions considered.\n\nSlide 10 \u2013 Factors to consider in the \u201cNew Normal\u201d\n\nSlide 11\u201113 \u2013 Demographics\nBigger populations are better, but labor\u2011market dynamics matter. China\u2019s one\u2011child policy led to a peak in 2010; its labor force is now shrinking. India\u2019s demographics will peak around 2030 with a still\u2011expanding labor force. Dependency ratios illustrate these trends.\n\nSlide 14\u201115 \u2013 Climate\nClimate risk is rising. It\u2019s not just vulnerability; it\u2019s also the ability to respond. Taiwan is vulnerable to sea\u2011level rise but can build sea walls; Bangladesh cannot. Company\u2011level resilience matters \u2013 e.g., Czech Republic\u2019s CEZ gets 30\u201140% of its power from coal.\n\nSlide 16\u201117 \u2013 Geopolitics\nGeopolitical risk is becoming more important but is hard to predict. New World Order risk makes export\u2011dependent economies vulnerable. China depends on the world for food and energy, whereas Brazil\u2019s dependence runs the opposite way.\n\nSlide 18 \u2013 Weighting the factors\nIt is an art, not a science \u2013 total weighting sums to 100%.\n\nSlide 19\u201122 \u2013 Country and sector metrics\nTop and bottom countries on the new\u2011normal metric are identified. The \u201cNew Normal\u201d reduces country concentration without affecting other dimensions. China and Taiwan together fall to about 20% of the portfolio.\n\nSlide 23\u201125 \u2013 Sector weights and concentration\nSector weights of the \u201cNew Normal\u201d resemble the MSCI benchmark. Herfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index drops from 0.16 (MSCI EM) to 0.08 (New EM), indicating much lower concentration.\n\nSlide 26 \u2013 How investors could use this\nFor broad EM exposure, an ETF tracking the \u201cNew Normal\u201d offers a better exposure. Active managers can use it as a custom benchmark for country\u2011level bets. The presenter invites feedback.\n\nSlide 27 \u2013 Summary\nEM is broken and needs re\u2011imagining. The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio is neither a traditional index nor an active portfolio but a new way of thinking about sensible EM investing. Multiple factors matter; combining them is an art, not a science. The resulting portfolio is comfortable for long\u2011term ownership with minimal turnover. Bottom line: the \u201cNew Normal\u201d is a better way to invest in EM.",

However, as this new world order takes shape, the opportunity to reap the benefits of these countries becomes more important by the day. The rising power and influence of these countries has been described in the past as a sign of things to come, but we are in the early stages of human history and many are wondering if this is indeed true.\nThe first part of this analysis focuses on why we are in the rising power by default.

By 1+1 around the world, other powers feel the urge to fit in, but not all of the time.

Arjun Divecha suggests reimagining these countries and how we should think about investing in them.

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients whether the anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAt this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets, and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand.\n\nFor example, if we screen the MSCI World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50\u202f% of their sales from emerging markets, we find 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574\u202fbillion and make up only 2.1\u202f% of the market value of the MSCI World Index (see Exhibit\u202f6 for the ten largest companies in this group \u2013 not exactly the household names one expects to see).\n\nIn addition, locally\u2011domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home\u2011field advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well\u2011established local brands, government policies that tend to favour locals, and the fact that local competitors often have high profitability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share.\n\nA good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia would be extremely expensive. Moreover, they would face great difficulty competing against a well\u2011established player such as Magnit, which runs more than 4,000 stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20\u202f%. We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where it paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",
      "model_response": "(Please provide a detailed analysis)ollectors of data indicate that there is high growth in demand in emerging economies, particularly in areas such as hardware, electronics, software, and biotechnology. \n\nHowever, they do not predict much growth in demand in domestic countries. The main reason is the high cost of capital in these countries compared to developed markets. \n\nMultinational companies have their own strategies to capture this growth opportunity. They set up representative offices in these countries, sign contracts for the production of their products, and share a cut of the revenue. \n\nOn the other hand, domestic companies try to reach out to these countries via their own marketing departments. They set up representative offices and sign contracts for the production of their products. However, the cost of capital in these countries is higher than in developed markets, as they have no representative offices or can only hire on- demand basis. \n\nIn recent times, we have seen an upturn in demand in emerging markets particularly in the domain of e-commerce. \n\nTherefore, we believe that this high growth in demand in emerging economies can best be captured by investing in multinational companies. However, domestic companies should not ignore the opportunity and should look into setting up representative offices in these countries to maximize their share of the revenue.",
