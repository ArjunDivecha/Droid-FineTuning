      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n**Implications for Portfolio Managers**\n\nEven though individual emerging markets are risky, their low correlations with each other and with developed markets enable risk reduction for modest allocations. Figure\u202f7 (Exhibit\u202f7) illustrates the risk\u2011return trade\u2011off of mixing the IFC Emerging Markets Index with the FT World Index over the five\u2011year period ending March\u202f1991. Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest. As emerging markets develop stronger financial and trade links with the rest of the world, correlations are expected to increase, eroding this free lunch.\n\nBecause of the high within\u2011market homogeneity, active managers should focus on **country selection** rather than intensive stock picking. The larger impact of country selection is evident in the higher volatility and return dispersion across countries. Nevertheless, constructing low\u2011tracking\u2011error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuable, especially given the illiquidity of many small\u2011cap stocks. Exhibit\u202f8 shows that tracking the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX in Taiwan, and the S&P\u202f500 requires roughly 75, 90, and 135 stocks respectively to achieve a 1\u202f% tracking error with two\u2011thirds confidence.\n\nFinally, the authors note that many emerging economies are projected to sustain higher real economic growth than developed economies, suggesting that medium\u2011 to long\u2011term equity returns should reflect this advantage. Coupled with diversification benefits, the case for adding emerging\u2011market exposure to a global portfolio is compelling.\n\n**Endnotes & References**\n\nThe paper cites sources such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook\u202f1991,\u201d Brown\u202f(1991), Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f(1989), and Roll\u202f(1990). The authors conclude that while emerging markets present heightened volatility, the combination of low cross\u2011market correlations, high within\u2011market homogeneity, and superior growth prospects creates a unique risk\u2011return profile for global investors.\n\n*Key take\u2011aways*\n\n* Low correlations across emerging markets \u2192 diversification benefit.\n* High within\u2011market homogeneity \u2192 country selection matters more than stock picking.\n* Modest (\u224820\u202f%) emerging\u2011market allocation can reduce portfolio risk and boost return.\n* The \u201cfree lunch\u201d may diminish as markets become more integrated.\n* Constructing index\u2011tracking baskets is feasible with relatively few stocks due to homogeneity.",

In this article we propose a methodology to further reduce the risk of a global portfolio\u2014through increased investments in emerging markets!\\n\\nModest investments in emerging markets actually reduce risk\\nExhibit 1 shows the effect of adding an emerging markets index fund (the IFC Global Index, in this case) to a global portfolio (FT World Index) over the period January 1988 to December 1992. We see that putting 20% of your money into emerging markets not only reduces risk from 15.5% to about 14.5%, but also increases overall annual portfolio return (over the past five years) from 7.69% to just over 10%. In fact, investments of up to 50% in the emerging markets would have reduced risk and increased return relative to the FT World Index. This risk reduction (and return enhancement) is not simply an artifact of the past five years\u2014it is true for any five\u2011year (or longer) period since 1985 (when the IFC Index was created).\\n\\nThis analysis assumes that the investor buys an emerging markets index fund; that is, weights countries in proportion to their market capitalization. The results are likely to be true for any well\u2011diversified emerging markets portfolio. Putting all of one's emerging markets assets into one region, such as Latin America, would not result in a well\u2011diversified portfolio. Lacking any other information, how should one allocate money to different countries or regions? Is indexation, using market\u2011capitalization weights, the right answer?\\n\\nCapitalization weighting requires heroic assumptions\\nThe case for weighting countries according to their market capitalization is tenuous at best, even in the developed markets. To weight countries in proportion to their market capitalization, one has to assume that markets are efficiently priced. If markets are not efficiently priced, market weighting leads one to overweight \"overvalued\" countries (such as Japan in the late 1980s) and underweight \"undervalued\" countries.\\n\\nIn the emerging markets, where there are severe restrictions on what global investors can buy within each market, market weighting makes little sense, since the definition of what constitutes the market capitalization depends on who you are (local or foreigner) and what is available for you to buy. Furthermore, no market that went from 2,500 to 12,500 in two months and back to 5,000 in three months (as Taiwan did in 1991) can in any way be considered efficient.\\n\\nIn such bipolar markets, would one use the total market capitalization (available to the locals) or just the float available to foreigners to determine each country's weight? These two methods lead to radically different weights for countries such as Korea, Taiwan, and India. Korea forms 14.9% of the IFC Global Index, but only 3.3% of the IFC Investable Index (as of June 1, 1993). The difference between the two indices is that the IFC Global index uses total market capitalization while the IFC Investable index uses the float that is available to global investors.\\n\\nIf market capitalization weighting doesn't make any sense in the emerging markets, what does? One proposed solution is to use GDP weights. The World Bank, however, has recently redefined the GDP of countries based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) rather than current exchange rates. This causes the emerging markets (as a group) to go from about 20% of world GDP to just under 50%. Using this new definition of GDP weighting would require global investors to immediately shift many of their investments from the developed markets to the emerging markets. In short, using GDP weights now requires investors to make a judgment about how GDP is compared across countries (PPP or current exchange rates). The choices they make would cause huge differences in relative weights. Clearly this seems as arbitrary as market weighting.\\n\\nIf not market or GDP weights, then what?\\nAnother proposed solution is to use Low Volatility (LV) weighting. The concept is simple and well\u2011understood because of its relevance in the U.S. equity market. We pick the weights of each country that would create a minimum\u2011variance portfolio, viewed from the investor's numeraire currency. Thus, each country's weight is based on the amount it contributed to lowering the risk of the overall portfolio instead of its market capitalization. Countries that had the lowest predicted volatility coupled with low correlation with other markets would have the highest weight, and those with high predicted volatility or high correlation with other countries would have the lowest weight.\\n\\nThe theoretical basis for such a low\u2011volatility strategy is that the LV portfolio is likely to be close to the efficient frontier. One can forecast volatility with considerable accuracy; thus, a portfolio that is forecast to have low volatility ex\u2011ante is highly likely to have low volatility ex\u2011post. If we visualize an efficient frontier chart, we can be reasonably sure that the ex\u2011ante LV portfolio will be close to the ex\u2011post minimum\u2011variance point, even if we know nothing about what its return might be. On the other hand, one can make no such assertion about market\u2011weighted portfolios. One can only discover ex\u2011post whether they were close to the frontier or not. As a result, the LV portfolio is likely to be more mean\u2011variance (MV) efficient than the market portfolio.\\n\\nThus, while we would expect the LV portfolio to have lower volatility than the market portfolio, we have no ex\u2011ante forecast of the relative return of one vis\u2011a\u2011vis the other. If in fact the market portfolio is highly inefficient (that is, it is a deep interior point within the feasible set) it's possible that the return to the LV portfolio will be as high as, or higher than, the market portfolio. Numerous researchers have investigated this phenomenon within the U.S. market; use of a similar LV strategy was the subject of two earlier newsletter articles. Their work indicates that in the U.S. market, an LV portfolio would have outperformed the market portfolio while undertaking considerably lower risk.\\n\\nThis weighting scheme, therefore, has the multiple benefits of making sense (from an efficiency point of view), lowering risk (for an asset class whose image is synonymous with high risk), and having the possibility of doing at least as well as the market portfolio (if the U.S. precedent holds).",

That's only true, however, if you put a large proportion of your money in emerging markets. In the paper entitled \"Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective,\" I show that even when one controls the risk of a portfolio (through, for example, a capitalization ratio), the risk of a emerging markets portfolio will overwhelmingly outperform the same proportion of portfolios if managed consistently. In fact, my research shows that for every unit of risk controlled, an emerging markets portfolio would save 14% in management and 10% in investment control compared to a developed market portfolio. Thus, from an investment standpoint, one does not need to control risk at all; even an unmanaged emerging markets portfolio would save 14% on management and 10% on investment control compared to a developed market portfolio. There is only one constraint: One must spend 8% of your net income on emerging markets. This constraint applies whether one is managing a single emerging market or an entire emerging markets portfolio. In addition, one must have the ability to repeatedly rebalance the portfolio, so that it will always be managed in the client's (or manager's) \"optimal\" (rather than \"suboptimal\") state.

For example, India has a highly restrictive export structure because it is the largest consumer of food and beverages. Similarly, China has a highly restrictive export structure because it is the most industrial country in the world. While India makes sense from a business point of view, we don\u2019t think it makes sense from a economic development point of view. Similarly, we don\u2019t think the Chinese export structure makes much sense from a business point of view. It is a function of the government and creates a barrier to economic growth. On the other hand, we believe the Chinese export structure makes sense from a developmental point of view because it enables the Chinese to get food and drink to their consumers, which is a basic need of life. \nImpact on Economy: A China manufacturing exodus benefits the economy in the short run because manufacturers are\u8d31\u5de5\uff08loosely translated from Chinese to English) located in areas that are least attractive from a investment point",

The Emerging Markets (EM) team is highlighted, with a roster of senior professionals\u2014including fund managers Arjun Divecha, Cliff Gong, Amit Bhartia, Sam Wilderman, and a support staff of traders, analysts and operations specialists\u2014who together oversee a quantitative research process that emphasizes country\u2011level value, controlled risk, and disciplined execution.\n\nCore to GMO\u2019s philosophy is the conviction that \u201cvalue wins in the long run\u201d and that this effect is amplified in inefficient asset classes such as emerging\u2011market equities.

The model is described as a quadratic optimizer that maximizes a utility function defined as Alpha \u2013 Risk \u2013 Transaction Costs.  The firm argues that in emerging markets, country selection dominates sector selection because of lower economic integration, higher endogenous risk, and the outsized influence of local investors.\n\nThe slide deck also outlines the stock\u2011selection methodology: a blend of a proprietary value model (70\u202f% weight) and momentum signals (30\u202f% weight).

China and Taiwan together fall to about 20% of the portfolio.\n\nSlide 23\u201125 \u2013 Sector weights and concentration\nSector weights of the \u201cNew Normal\u201d resemble the MSCI benchmark. Herfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index drops from 0.16 (MSCI EM) to 0.08 (New EM), indicating much lower concentration.\n\nSlide 26 \u2013 How investors could use this\nFor broad EM exposure, an ETF tracking the \u201cNew Normal\u201d offers a better exposure. Active managers can use it as a custom benchmark for country\u2011level bets. The presenter invites feedback.\n\nSlide 27 \u2013 Summary\nEM is broken and needs re\u2011imagining. The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio is neither a traditional index nor an active portfolio but a new way of thinking about sensible EM investing. Multiple factors matter; combining them is an art, not a science. The resulting portfolio is comfortable for long\u2011term ownership with minimal turnover. Bottom line: the \u201cNew Normal\u201d is a better way to invest in EM.",

There are good reasons for this stance especially given the close past relationship with Russia plus its dependence on Russian arms and ability to get oil at reduced rates. On the other hand, India and the US share China as their primary adversary and the US is India\u2019s largest investment and trading partner so it makes sense to remain connected to the US.\n\nThis middle path might have worked in normal times, but I am of the view that we are on the cusp of a new and more polarized world order where everyone is going to have to choose sides. India can try to create a new \u201cnon-aligned\u201d bloc but given how poorly it worked out the last time (Nehru\u2019s folly) it makes little sense to sit on the fence.

In this situation, I don\u2019t believe the Chinese will be thrilled with the Russians selling arms to India or doing India any favors. In this new world order, India will get the short end of the stick by allying with the new Russia/China/Pakistan axis.\n\nThe only way for India to meaningfully resist the Chinese, both economically and militarily, is to partner with the Quad (India, US, Australia and Japan) all of whom have their own reasons to take on China in a meaningful way.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients whether the anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAt this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets, and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand.\n\nFor example, if we screen the MSCI World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50\u202f% of their sales from emerging markets, we find 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574\u202fbillion and make up only 2.1\u202f% of the market value of the MSCI World Index (see Exhibit\u202f6 for the ten largest companies in this group \u2013 not exactly the household names one expects to see).\n\nIn addition, locally\u2011domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home\u2011field advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well\u2011established local brands, government policies that tend to favour locals, and the fact that local competitors often have high profitability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share.\n\nA good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia would be extremely expensive. Moreover, they would face great difficulty competing against a well\u2011established player such as Magnit, which runs more than 4,000 stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20\u202f%. We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where it paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multin",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",
      "model_response": "ationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies within emerging markets. In cases where the domestic opportunity is also great, we have seen multinationals that are domiciled within emerging markets do extremely well. A good example is the Dutch company NMS, which set up a local\u00a0subsidiary company in India in 1931 and has been listed on the Indian stock market\u00a0since 1956. While NMS has had good years in India, we believe its future success\u00a0depends more on local opportunities than it does on strong multinationals\u2019 influence in emerging markets.\u00a0Instead of trying to force demand from local competitors, NMS has used a \u201cdo or die\u201d\u00a0strategy \u2013 it has made no sense to sit on the\u00a0back\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0cheaper\u00a0share\u00a0of\u00a0ownership\u00a0while\u00a0other\u00a0domiciled\u00a0companies\u00a0suffer\u00a0the\u00a0curse\u00a0of\u00a0oversized\u00a0competitors.\n\nLast year, we saw the completion of NMS\u2019 transition to a locally\u2011based company. Instead of trying to force demand from the local competitors, NMS has decided to take a \u201cdo or die\u201d approach to this transition \u2013 it will not allow the Indian market\u00a0to be empty. We are working on a revised strategy that would give greater consideration to local demand and minimize the risks associated with it.

In short, either you go along with our program or we\u2019ll do it for you.\n\nFinally, jailing Mr. Khodorkovsky is a clear warning to other oligarchs and business leaders that they should steer clear of politics and contemplate sublimating their political desires into ownership of sports franchises outside Russia. The San Francisco 49ers could certainly use a deep\u2011pocketed owner. Yo! Potanin, over here!\n\nIn short, Mr. Putin intends to have complete control of all levels of political and economic activity. It is telling that the only dissenting voice to speak up is that of his own maverick economic advisor Andrei Illarionov who said, \u201cThe sale of Yuganskneftegaz to a mystical, and now not so mystical, company named Baikal Finance Group has won this year\u2019s \u2018shady deal\u2019 of the year award.\u201d While Mr. Putin has ignored the free\u2011speaking Illarionov\u2019s inflammatory comments in the past, it will be interesting to see how he will react to this outburst.\n\nIf Mr. Putin succeeds in creating this new paradigm of government\u2011sponsored capitalism (and I believe that in the short run, he very well might), my fear is that he will create a new model for development that will be detrimental to minority shareholders such as ourselves, not just in Russia, but elsewhere as well.\n\nSo will he succeed? With high oil prices, a reduced foreign debt load, and massive foreign exchange reserves, there are no dark clouds on the horizon. While recent economic growth has been extremely dependent on high oil prices, we have started to see the beginnings of a consumer society that could fuel growth for the next few years.\n\nLooking at the history of other authoritarian regimes, one sees that they tend to succeed in their early phases \u2013 what I call the Bill Parcells\u00b9 effect \u2013 that intimidation does \u2026\n\nEleven years ago, GMO\u2019s Annual Client Conference (soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union), I said I believed we were living in a golden age of capitalism. With communism and socialism having been so thoroughly and comprehensively discredited, there was only one competing paradigm for economic development \u2013 that of free and open markets and privatization of government owned companies, rather than nationalization and central planning. It was based on this shift that I made my long\u2011term case for investing in emerging markets (although from a short\u2011term point of view, October 1993 did not represent particularly good timing on my part).\n\nI also said that I did not believe that this golden age would last forever, that former socialists/authoritarians had not suddenly turned into committed free\u2011traders, but were biding their time and would surely make a re\u2011appearance some day, selling the same old vodka in new bottles.\n\nThat day may now have arrived in Russia.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Putin is trying to create a model of the modern authoritarian state where private corporations and government owned/controlled entities both serve some greater \u201cnational good\u201d in addition to attempting to enrich their shareholders.\n\nThe Yukos case serves as a multi\u2011pronged attempt in attaining this goal. On one hand, it is perhaps the first step in reversing some of the privatizations of the early 90s and to establish a \u201cnational energy company\u201d \u2013 a government controlled energy giant that would play in the same league as OPEC. While economic reasons play a role, the primary motivation is to serve Russia\u2019s geopolitical goals. In a post 9/11 world of energy insecurity, Russia\u2019s energy assets have more strategic clout than their nuclear missiles.\n\nAnother aspect is to send a very clear signal to Mr. Khodorkovsky and his fellow oligarchs that companies \u2026",

A time\u2011series chart of the GMO Emerging Markets Fund\u2019s China overweight/underweight position from 2000\u20112021 visualises how the fund has historically adjusted exposure. \n\nThe \u201cEM\u202f\u00d7\u202fChina\u201d case study shows that removing China from the benchmark cuts roughly 40\u202f% of the stock opportunity set, but a top\u2011down, country\u2011selection overlay mitigates the loss. Comparative tables illustrate that portfolio characteristics (value, quality, sector tilt) remain very similar between the full\u2011EM and ex\u2011China strategies.

The presentation ends with a call to action: use the \u201cReading the Xi Leaves\u201d framework to assess sector exposure, stay vigilant to regulatory signals, and consider the EM\u202f\u00d7\u202fChina overlay to balance upside potential with risk control.

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nWe have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global rivals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",

He is extremely plugged in with the financial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefit. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions.\n\nIn my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and financial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long\u2011term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital?\n\nOne of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by Edward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high\u2011speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure financial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high\u2011speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high\u2011speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high\u2011speed rail in expansive continental geographies.\n\nIn short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have difficult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years).\n\nThe one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government actually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song). As you may guess, none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profits by investing in telecoms outside of India. This is what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high profits because producers benefitted from shortages.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of bad policy\u2011making (India consistently runs high budget deficits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high\u2011return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefits investors by delivering high return on investment.\n\nNow this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India benefits from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high\u2011cost\u2011of\u2011capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth.\n\nI believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to grow. We already see inflation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High inflation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high\u2011inflation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs.\n\nNevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom\u2011up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state\u2011directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profit\u2011maximizers.\n\nIn the final analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profitability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t focus on growth. Focus on profitability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation \u2013 we are willing to pay a premium for profitability, but not to overpay for it.\n\nCurrent positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring inflation down, a task that is made much harder by the proliferate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of Arjun Divecha and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nArjun Divecha\n\nOver the last 4 years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term.\n\nWe examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we\u2019re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\nChart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next 12 months.\n\nWhat this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form 55% of our country\u2011selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deli",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nver out\u2011performance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets.\n\n**Stock Picking Within Country \u2013 How Cheap Are Value and Small\u2011Cap Stocks?**\nLooking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks have been over time, relative to the index. Value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the 15\u2011year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively out\u2011performed. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it\u2019s still at a 34% discount)?\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing.\n\nSo, if value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Let\u2019s first look at small\u2011cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they\u2019re not as cheap as they usually are either. That\u2019s exactly what Chart 3 shows \u2013 the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance.",

The narrative stresses that the U.S.\u2013China \u201cEconomic War\u201d is a long\u2011run battle over technology, military power, and ideology, and that the combined weight of Taiwan and China represents roughly half of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, creating a negative net effect for that asset class. Memories of Covid\u201119 disruptions and climate\u2011change\u2011induced shocks further motivate diversification. The slide concludes that there is no single \u201cone\u2011stop\u201d alternative to China; instead, on\u2011shoring, near\u2011shoring, and friend\u2011shoring each present distinct investment opportunities, with the presenter focusing on the latter two.\n\nSlide\u202f3 asks why China has fallen out of favor, listing six factors: (1) demographics \u2013 labor\u2011force growth has turned negative after the one\u2011child policy; (2) capitalism \u2013 Deng\u2019s market\u2011opening reforms are being rolled back under Xi; (3) access to global markets \u2013 once expanded by Nixon\u2019s opening and WTO membership, now constrained by Western restrictions; (4) competence \u2013 decision\u2011making has shifted from collective mandarins to a more centralized Xi; (5) Covid\u201119; (6) \u201cKilling the golden geese,\u201d a metaphor for policy missteps that erode China\u2019s competitive advantage; plus housing issues and the \u201cbiggest failure of all \u2013 Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nSlide\u202f4 presents a chart from The Economist showing a steep rise in Chinese manufacturing labor costs per hour, underscoring the cost\u2011driven incentive to look elsewhere.\n\nSlide\u202f5 cites BofA Global Research and AlphaSense, noting that corporate presentations increasingly mention re\u2011/near\u2011/on\u2011shoring as supply\u2011chain strategies.\n\nSlide\u202f6\u20117 display a historical line graph (1994\u20112019) of the share of total U.S. goods imports coming from China, highlighting inflection points such as China\u2019s WTO entry, the trade war, and NAFTA. The share has been declining, indicating that the re\u2011allocation is already underway.\n\nSlide\u202f8 introduces a country\u2011framework matrix (Export Structure, Economic Impact, Domestic Market Size, Institutional Capacity, Companies Relocating, Labor & Demographics) used to evaluate alternative locations.\n\nSlide\u202f9 asks \u201cWho benefits from supply chains diversifying out of China?\u201d and sets up the analysis of emerging\u2011market institutions (Slide\u202f10\u201113) that will rank countries as \u201cTop\u201d or \u201cBottom\u201d across the framework dimensions. The slides list a long set of candidate nations (Czech Republic, Poland, Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, etc.) and categorize them by labor\u2011demographic strengths.\n\nOverall, this chunk weaves together a narrative, a metaphor (\u201cKilling the golden geese\u201d), and multiple data visualisations (labor\u2011cost chart, import\u2011share trend, country\u2011framework). It also contains the presenter\u2019s voice (\u201cWe present a strategy\u2026\u201d) and several memorable phrases.",
