Investors are reacting: a large sovereign\u2011wealth fund reduced overall EM exposure; Texas Teachers Pension announced it will cut China weight in half; a large endowment is shifting China weight by investing in GMO EM ex\u2011China fund. The growing weight of China mirrors the Japan\u2011in\u2011EAFE issue of the 1980s.\n\nSlide 4 \u2013 Index weight\nChina + Taiwan represent 45.5% of the MSCI EM index; China alone is 31.0%. China A\u2011Shares are only 20% of their market value in the index; full inclusion would raise China A\u2011Shares from 5% to 22% of MSCI.\n\nSlide 5 \u2013 Country\u2011level concentration\nHerfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index (HHI) shows a very lopsided portfolio when China/Taiwan dominate the EM index.\n\nSlide 6 \u2013 Cap weighting positives\nMarket\u2011cap weighting aligns with liquidity. Example: Alvaro\u2019s fund grew from $3\u202fbn to $10\u202fbn under cap weighting.\n\nSlide 7 \u2013 Equal weighting trade\u2011offs\nEqual weighting solves concentration but creates other issues; the same Alvaro example is cited.\n\nSlide 8 \u2013 Square\u2011root cap weighting\nA compromise: square\u2011root market\u2011cap weighting balances liquidity and concentration concerns.\n\nSlide 9 \u2013 The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio concept\nNot an index \u2013 construction involves judgment. Ideal features: focus on country weights, cap\u2011weight stocks within each country for liquidity, intuitive \u201csmell test\u201d, smaller China/Taiwan exposure emerging naturally, no single country or tightly correlated group dominates, multiple risk and opportunity dimensions considered.",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nSlide 10 \u2013 Factors to consider in the \u201cNew Normal\u201d\n\nSlide 11\u201113 \u2013 Demographics\nBigger populations are better, but labor\u2011market dynamics matter. China\u2019s one\u2011child policy led to a peak in 2010; its labor force is now shrinking. India\u2019s demographics will peak around 2030 with a still\u2011expanding labor force. Dependency ratios illustrate these trends.\n\nSlide 14\u201115 \u2013 Climate\nClimate risk is rising. It\u2019s not just vulnerability; it\u2019s also the ability to respond. Taiwan is vulnerable to sea\u2011level rise but can build sea walls; Bangladesh cannot. Company\u2011level resilience matters \u2013 e.g., Czech Republic\u2019s CEZ gets 30\u201140% of its power from coal.\n\nSlide 16\u201117 \u2013 Geopolitics\nGeopolitical risk is becoming more important but is hard to predict. New World Order risk makes export\u2011dependent economies vulnerable. China depends on the world for food and energy, whereas Brazil\u2019s dependence runs the opposite way.\n\nSlide 18 \u2013 Weighting the factors\nIt is an art, not a science \u2013 total weighting sums to 100%.\n\nSlide 19\u201122 \u2013 Country and sector metrics\nTop and bottom countries on the new\u2011normal metric are identified. The \u201cNew Normal\u201d reduces country concentration without affecting other dimensions. China and Taiwan together fall to about 20% of the portfolio.\n\nSlide 23\u201125 \u2013 Sector weights and concentration\nSector weights of the \u201cNew Normal\u201d resemble the MSCI benchmark. Herfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index drops from 0.16 (MSCI EM) to 0.08 (New EM), indicating much lower concentration.\n\nSlide 26 \u2013 How investors could use this\nFor broad EM exposure, an ETF tracking the \u201cNew Normal\u201d offers a better exposure. Active managers can use it as a custom benchmark for country\u2011level bets. The presenter invites feedback.\n\nSlide 27 \u2013 Summary\nEM is broken and needs re\u2011imagining. The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio is neither a traditional index nor an active portfolio but a new way of thinking about sensible EM investing. Multiple factors matter; combining them is an art, not a science. The resulting portfolio is comfortable for long\u2011term ownership with minimal turnover. Bottom line: the \u201cNew Normal\u201d is a better way to invest in EM.",

Even with judgment, there are non\u2011unique solutions. Examples are provided to illustrate the judgment\u2011making process.\n\nSlide 11 \u2013 Important reminder\nDecisions about the \u201cNew Normal\u201d are personal and subjective. There is no one correct answer; what matters is making a judgment that feels right and justifying it intuitively, even if others may have different viewpoints.\n\nSlide 12 \u2013 The way forward\nAs a private\u2011equity investor, the focus is on company selection within the \u201cNew Normal\u201d framework. Key tasks include: evaluating which sectors/countries/ companies are best positioned to benefit from the \u201cNew Normal\u201d, applying traditional value\u2011driven investing within this new context, and remaining vigilant for other emerging\u2011market opportunities that may arise.

Well, not all of India, but an important part of it which depends on government policy action. The reason is the exposure of corruption and scandals associated with government officials taking bribes. \nCorruption has been endemic in India since the time of independence in 1947 (and maybe well before that as well). What\u2019s different this time is that the media have been exposing this corruption and on the back of these revelations important people (more specifically senior politicians and billionaires) are being put in jail and are being kept there, with judges refusing to grant them bail. \nIn the past, these same people would give and take bribes with impunity, secure in the knowledge that they were above scrutiny and prosecution and even if they were sent to jail, could live a 5 star luxury lifestyle while there, with home cooked meals, internet access, personal butlers and afternoon tea with the wardens. In the harsh light of intense media scrutiny, all that has changed. Things have got so bad that there\u2019s anecdotal evidence that industrialists are refusing to give bribes to politicians on the grounds that the politicians are not acting despite being bribed!!! \nThis is not the fear of an innocent person being unfairly accused, but of a guilty person being afraid being exposed. Accusing a politician of corruption in India is akin to handing out speeding tickets at the",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nIndy 500*. \nNow this may sound like a very positive change, and in fact, in the long run, it probably is. However, in the short run, it has had a chilling effect on all aspects of government action \u2013 no action is being taken on new projects, projects that have been approved are not being funded and even works in progress (like road construction) have halted as funds are not being disbursed. \nI have often made the argument that India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. However, India has a high need for government action in the arena of infrastructure, supply chains etc. and there\u2019s evidence that bottlenecks in the economy are creating a serious impediment to fast growth without inflationary pressure. In fact the Reserve Bank is so worried that it raised rates 50bps today and in effect told the government to get off its butt and deal with the bottlenecks -\n \u201cIt is important to recognize that in the absence of appropriate actions for addressing supply bottlenecks, especially in food and infrastructure, questions about the ability of the economy to sustain the current growth rate without significant inflationary pressures come to the fore. The economy's ability to grow rapidly for any length of time without provoking inflation is dependent on implementing policies, with corresponding resource allocations, which will allow the supply of various products and services to keep pace with demand.\u201d\n* Reference from the movie Apocalypse Now",
      "model_response": "Vatican \u2013 you know it\u2019s true, but have no chance of being heard. However, once the scandal breaks out, there is no going back and the media will pursue it with relentlessness. The recent exposure of the anti-corruption guru Lateesh Kumar\u2019s involvement with bribes led to his arrest and jail. Lateesh had previously set up a company, Kuber, which ended up being the vehicle through which bribes were paid to politicians and later on to Bollywood celebrities. Kuber is now being sued by the government of India for allegedly defrauding the country of Rs 30,000 crore (approx $4.5 billion). The court has ordered Kuber to pay 50% of the damages or else it will be forced to pay the full amount. This is a game changer \u2013 it is sending a very clear signal to criminals that they will not get away with their crimes. \nIf in doubt, look at the case of Bollywood celebrity Amit Shahi (better known as Amitabh Saroor). He was a respected anti-corruption activist until he got involved with money laundering and began to make money off the corruption. The media started to ask questions and he faced intense scrutiny. He tried to game the system by getting himself arrested on charges of contempt of court (he had previously got the media to publish his manifesto and he got a lifetime ban from speaking in the US). He got a slap on the wrist and was ordered to pay Rs 50 lakh",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nAt the end of the day (as we mentioned earlier), it\u2019s not about multinationals versus locals, but which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profits that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we find that the best (but not all) opportunities are local.\n\nPerformance data supports this view. Exhibit\u202f7 shows that emerging domestic companies have outperformed developed multinationals over the past five years, while Exhibit\u202f8 demonstrates that emerging domestic stocks still trade at a modest discount to their multinational peers. The outperformance is driven by faster earnings growth rather than valuation expansion.\n\nNot all domestic opportunities are attractive. Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel).\n\nSimilarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profitability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profitability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15\u202fmillion net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profitability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. On the other hand, the financial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well\u2011established, highly profitable banks. Only about 2\u202f% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefit from this growth without having to lower their margins.\n\nThe key is to look for fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows players to have high profitability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profitability in the face of non\u2011linear demand increases are most attractive. Profitability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter.\n\n**Conclusions**\nAs a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be reflected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers.\n\nThe winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home\u2011field advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.\n\n*Disclaimer*: The views expressed are those of Arjun Divecha through the period ending 8/17/11 and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

In the emerging markets, we look for fast\u2011growing economies (high GDP growth) coupled with large populations that are becoming consumers (the \u201cYaurico\u201d canvas) that create a large market base, and we\u2019ve identified a number of countries that fit this mold (see Exhibit\u202f5 for the list of \u201cpromising\u201d emerging markets).\n\nWithin each emerging market, we focus on sectors where the largest growth is occurring.

And right now, like in 1998, everybody with half a brain can see that these new technologies are going to be huge. But, unfortunately, there are very few ways to play that glorious future that\u2019s in the near future.\n\nWe all know the story of Levi Strauss & Co. during the California Gold Rush \u2013 the equipment suppliers that made money in that bubble.\n\nAnd so we see Cisco and Nvidia today in a similar vein. \n\nBut once the technology starts to be used to actually change the world, other companies are major beneficiaries (like Amazon, Google etc.) and the equipment suppliers are correctly seen as commodity producers with low margins as competition seeps in.\n\nAnd so it is today. Here\u2019s a chart of Cisco vs Nvidia starting 18 months before the top of the tech bubble on a similar time and return scale.\n\nAre we now at the top for Nvidia? That\u2019s unknowable.\n\nAs my colleague Jeremey Grantham likes to say, trying to figure out the top of a bubble is like charting the path of a feather in a hurricane. You have no idea as to how far or how high it will go. There is only one thing you know with certainty. It will hit the ground.\n\nAnd so it was with Cisco\u2026 \n\nIf you bought it at the top - almost 25 years later, you\u2019re still losing money.\n\n\n\nSo will Nvidia follow suit?

Historically value stocks trade at a 40\u202f% discount to the index; today they sit at a 34\u202f% discount \u2013 the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in the fifteen\u2011year history for which we have data. The discount fell from a 46\u202f% discount in October\u202f2000 to the current 34\u202f% discount, a period during which value massively out\u2011performed.\n\nWe have no data to tell us how value behaves when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure \u2013 it\u2019s unlikely to be a good thing. If value isn\u2019t attractive, what is? Small\u2011cap stocks are the next logical place to look because smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness. Chart\u202f3 shows that the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all\u2011time high of 32\u202f% in October\u202f2000 to just 12\u202f% today. This contraction in both value and small\u2011cap spreads occurred because both segments performed extremely well over the past four years, greatly helping our performance.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nThe question we ask ourselves is, \u201cIf value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?\u201d\n\nWe first examined \u201cgrowth\u201d stocks \u2013 companies forecast to have the highest earnings growth over the next two years. As expected, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but Chart\u202f4 shows they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive.\n\nAnother group we follow closely is high\u2011quality stocks (Chart\u202f5). In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory would suggest. In emerging markets, quality stocks usually trade at a modest 9\u202f% premium to the market. Right now we can pick up these profitable, stable, low\u2011debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market.\n\nOver the past two years we have been developing a new measure of value that incorporates quality, and we had planned to replace our current \u201cValue\u201d model with a \u201cQuality\u2011Adjusted\u2011Value\u201d model later this year. Given the current positioning of both",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nvalue and quality, we began transitioning to the new model in May\u202f2004.\n\nIn the new model we explicitly adjust a stock\u2019s attractiveness for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio will rise as quality becomes relatively cheap, while the bet on what might be called \u201cjunky\u201d value stocks will fall. It also increases the average size of companies we own \u2013 a welcome change now that small caps are no longer attractive.\n\nOverall, 70\u202f% of our stock\u2011selection process remains value\u2011driven and 30\u202f% momentum\u2011driven. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value; that\u2019s precisely why we use both strategies \u2013 to diversify each other.\n\n**What Should You Do About This?**\n\nWhen we say our ability to add value is diminished, the appropriate response is not to abandon emerging markets. Valuations for the asset class suggest emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall exposure if you are overweight the asset class, but emerging equities remain among the most attractive asset classes based on our asset\u2011allocation group\u2019s seven\u2011year forecast, and GMO is heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our allocation products.\n\nAnother response would be to move money to another emerging manager. However, the contraction of value has not created greater opportunities elsewhere, so switching styles would not be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs.\n\nClients who have been with us have enjoyed the value and small\u2011cap rally. While we aim to deliver out\u2011performance of about 4\u202f% per year, the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark by 13.1\u202f% in calendar\u2011year\u2011end\u202f2003, after out\u2011performing by 4.7\u202f% in 2002 and 8.1\u202f% in 2001. If the compression of value leads to tougher times in the next couple of years, at least you have already reaped the benefits of that compression.\n\nWe are battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don\u2019t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride.",
      "model_response": "segments, we decided it was time to make the switch. Our new model, which we have been testing in our back\u2011testing and simulation modules, will start with a 70\u202f% weighting for value and 30\u202f% for quality. We will monitor its performance and plan to move the weighting closer to 50/50 as quality becomes more attractive.\n\nWe also intend to increase our bet on other \u201cbeyond\u2011value\u201d strategies as quality becomes less attractive relative to the market. Disposition of property within these strategies represents 70\u202f% of our current portfolio weight and we have a large number of \u201cbeyond\u2011value\u201d ideas in our pipeline that we plan to add to as opportunities present themselves.\n\nFinally, as in cou**n**try selection, putting 20\u202f% of our money in emerging markets is a long\u2011term bet that the asset class can be priced with a single number. Emerging markets make up 20\u202f% of our portfolio and will remain with us for the long haul, but we intend to modulate the country weight as our portfolio construction and stock picking abilities improve.\n\n**In Summary**\n\n*   **Value is not well positioned \u2013 it has become the first of many \u201cbeyond\u2011value\u201d strategies to be priced correctly.\n*   **Small\u2011cap is also not well positioned, although the contraction of both segments has been beneficial to our performance.\n*   **We are already working on",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nRuminations on China and India\nArjun Divecha\n\nChina: If you build it, they will come\u2026\nIndia: You\u2019re not going to build it, but they\u2019ll come anyway\u2026\n\nIt occurred to me that this is a good metaphor for China and India and the resulting implications for growth and investment return.\n\nLast month I had a long chat with one of the people in China whose views I most respect. He is extremely plugged in with the financial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefit. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions.\n\nIn my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and financial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long\u2011term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital?\n\nOne of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by Edward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high\u2011speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure financial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high\u2011speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high\u2011speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high\u2011speed rail in expansive continental geographies.\n\nIn short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have difficult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years).\n\nThe one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government actually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song). As you may guess, none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profits by investing in telecoms outside of India. This",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nis what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high profits because producers benefitted from shortages.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of bad policy\u2011making (India consistently runs high budget deficits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high\u2011return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefits investors by delivering high return on investment.\n\nNow this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India benefits from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high\u2011cost\u2011of\u2011capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth.\n\nI believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to grow. We already see inflation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High inflation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high\u2011inflation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs.\n\nNevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom\u2011up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state\u2011directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profit\u2011maximizers.\n\nIn the final analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profitability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t focus on growth. Focus on profitability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation \u2013 we are willing to pay a premium for profitability, but not to overpay for it.\n\nCurrent positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring inflation down, a task that is made much harder by the proliferate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of Arjun Divecha and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**A Model to Understand Risk and Return**\n\nTo analyze risk and return, the authors develop a multi\u2011factor model similar to that used for developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f[1989]). The model hierarchically decomposes portfolio excess return (return beyond the risk\u2011free rate) into currency return, local excess return, and a cross\u2011product term. Equation\u202f(1) expresses excess numeraire return as:\n\n    Excess Numeraire Return = (Currency Return) \u2013 (Local Excess Return) + (Cross\u2011Product)\n\nwhere the currency return captures exchange\u2011rate effects and interest\u2011rate differentials, the local excess return reflects the asset\u2019s performance in its home market, and the cross\u2011product term (r_c \u00d7 r_l) is usually small and can be ignored for most markets. However, for Argentina and Brazil the cross\u2011product is material (changing annual risk by 17\u202f% and 4\u202f% respectively), so the authors model these assets directly in U.S. dollars rather than decomposing them.\n\nLocal excess return is further broken into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk\u2011index return (size, earnings\u2011to\u2011price, liquidity, etc.). Exposures to country factors are measured by betas to the market of each country; industry exposures use the Financial Times World\u2011Wide (FTWW) classification; risk\u2011index exposures are normalized within each country.\n\nThe model was estimated for assets from 23 emerging markets (February\u202f1986\u202f\u2013\u202fJuly\u202f1991) using data from the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources. The adjusted R\u00b2 for the full emerging\u2011markets model is 50\u202f%, compared with 38\u202f% for a comparable developed\u2011markets model. Two sub\u2011models help explain this difference:\n\n1. **Industry\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Industry Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 16\u202f% for emerging markets versus 22\u202f% for developed markets, indicating weaker cross\u2011country industry integration in emerging markets.\n\n2. **Country\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 46\u202f% for emerging markets versus 30\u202f% for developed markets, showing that country\u2011specific forces dominate emerging\u2011market returns.\n\n**Homogeneity within markets**\n\nThe large cou",
      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nntry\u2011factor contribution implies that stock returns within a given emerging market are more homogeneous than in developed markets. Even when stocks are equally weighted, the R\u00b2 remains high (42\u202f% vs. 29\u202f% for developed markets). The authors explore three possible explanations:\n\n* **Concentration effect** \u2013 a few large stocks dominate market capitalization.\n* **True homogeneity** \u2013 stocks move together regardless of size.\n* **Volatility\u2011driven R\u00b2** \u2013 higher market volatility inflates the explanatory power of the market factor.\n\nExhibit\u202f3 shows that most emerging markets are indeed more concentrated than developed markets, but the difference is modest. Asset\u2011concentration scores (a measure ranging from 0 for perfectly equal weights to 1 for total concentration) average around 0.13 for the larger emerging markets, compared with 0.08 for the U.S. market. Sector\u2011concentration scores are similarly modest; only a few small markets (e.g., Jordan, Nigeria) exhibit high sector concentration.\n\nWhen concentration is controlled for, the average unweighted correlation of monthly stock returns within each market remains higher for emerging markets (e.g., Taiwan 0.77, Brazil 0.70) than for developed markets (U.S. 0.49, Japan 0.46). This suggests a dominant market\u2011wide force that overwhelms industry differentials.\n\n**Heterogeneity across markets**\n\nIn contrast, emerging markets are weakly correlated with each other. Exhibit\u202f4 reports average pairwise correlations of only 0.07 over the five\u2011year sample, with many negative pairings (89 of 276 correlations are negative). The authors attribute this to limited trade links and restrictive foreign\u2011participation rules that insulated markets from one another. As globalization progresses, they expect these correlations to rise.\n\nBy comparison, developed markets exhibit an average correlation of 0.49 (Exhibit\u202f5), and the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the FT World Index is 0.35.\n\nThese findings have direct portfolio implications: low cross\u2011market correlations provide diversification benefits, while high within\u2011market homogeneity means that country selection, rather than stock picking, drives active returns in emerging markets.",

Exhibit\u202f4 (Herfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index) shows that Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and Korea exhibit concentration patterns similar to those of developed markets, while most other emerging markets have lower concentration. However, the index is correlated with market capitalization; larger markets tend to be more concentrated. When the authors control for market capitalization, the correlation disappears, suggesting that these markets actually have lower concentration than developed markets. Thus, this effect is unlikely to explain homogeneity.\n\n* **Common factor effect** \u2013 a small number of fundamental factors drive returns across all companies within a market. The authors compare the betas to the market factor of the 100 largest companies with those of the market as a whole. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that betas are broadly correlated with market beta, but there is a clear outlier: small\u2011cap stocks in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and Korea have betas that are 20\u202f% to 40\u202f% lower than their market\u2011sector counterparts.

Figure\u202f7 (Exhibit\u202f7) illustrates the risk\u2011return trade\u2011off of mixing the IFC Emerging Markets Index with the FT World Index over the five\u2011year period ending March\u202f1991. Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest.

The larger impact of country selection is evident in the higher volatility and return dispersion across countries. Nevertheless, constructing low\u2011tracking\u2011error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuable, especially given the illiquidity of many small\u2011cap stocks. Exhibit\u202f8 shows that tracking the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX in Taiwan, and the S&P\u202f500 requires roughly 75, 90, and 135 stocks respectively to achieve a 1\u202f% tracking error with two\u2011thirds confidence.\n\nFinally, the authors note that many emerging economies are projected to sustain higher real economic growth than developed economies, suggesting that medium\u2011 to long\u2011term equity returns should reflect this advantage. Coupled with diversification benefits, the case for adding emerging\u2011market exposure to a global portfolio is compelling.\n\n**Endnotes & References**\n\nThe paper cites sources such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook\u202f1991,\u201d Brown\u202f(1991), Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f(1989), and Roll\u202f(1990). The authors conclude that while emerging markets present heightened volatility, the combination of low cross\u2011market correlations, high within\u2011market homogeneity, and superior growth prospects creates a unique risk\u2011return profile for global investors.\n\n*Key take\u2011aways*\n\n* Low correlations across emerging markets \u2192 diversification benefit.\n* High within\u2011market homogeneity \u2192 country selection matters more than stock picking.\n* Modest (\u224820\u202f%) emerging\u2011market allocation can reduce portfolio risk and boost return.\n* The \u201cfree lunch\u201d may diminish as markets become more integrated.\n* Constructing index\u2011tracking baskets is feasible with relatively few stocks due to homogeneity.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nIn 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF).\n\nI have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, \u201cThe four most dangerous words in the English language are \u2013 This Time it\u2019s Different\u201d. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that\u2019s why we got it wrong.\n\nWe manage EMF with a focus on the top down \u2013 our view is (and has been for the entire 28\u2011year period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60\u201170% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors.\n\nWe do this in a primarily quantitative fashion \u2013 using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions \u2013 value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance.\n\nThis strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and it remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies.\n\nWith that as background, let\u2019s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis.\n\nRussia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation.\n\nSo then the question became \u2013 in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether?\n\nAlas, we did not.\n\nWhat was our thinking behind this?\n\nWe believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all\u2011out assault on the entire country, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, a 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes.\n\nBut even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about\u2011face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well.\n\nThe issues in our minds are \u2013 what could/should we have done differently?\n\nFirst of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black\u2011swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex\u2011ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Let\u2019s assume that I\u2019m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be devoted to protecting against black\u2011swan events, i.e., how much tail\u2011risk insurance should you buy?\n\nThe answer I come to is the same I did prior to this \u2013 very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions.\n\nThe next question is did we right\u2011size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide \u2013 our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not led to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8\u20119%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin\u2019s eyes\u2026\n\nChina / Taiwan beckons\u2026",

As I said in my Emerging Thoughts piece on Mr. Putin\u2019s early days in July 2000 (\u201cPutin on the Ritz\u201d), \u201cAs fund managers, we need to be able to distinguish the unpalatable from the unprofitable.\u201d\n\nSo, what are we doing about this situation? Our country selection process has four elements \u2013 three based on objective, quantitative data and one based on our judgment, which represents 10% of the overall assessment of a country.\n\nCurrently, the quantitative parts of the model are quite negative on Russia, with a combined score of -0.9 (which is quite negative). While the market is relatively cheap (based on high oil company profits) our momentum and macroeconomic models are quite negative. This negative score translates into a moderately large underweighting relative to the benchmark.\n\nGiven the risks I\u2019ve talked about, it makes sense that we should have a negative judgment on Russia. If we were to assess a score of -1.0 on our judgment, the overall score for Russia would fall to -1.2 and our underweighting would increase by 1/2 a percent.\n\nWere the quantitative parts of the model to turn positive over the coming months, we would increase our weight in Russia, recognizing that our judgment serves as a drag on how much we buy, but does not override it.\n\nWould we override the entire process and get out of Russia altogether? Yes, in an extreme circumstance. However, these kinds of systemic overrides are few and far between. The last time we chose to get out a country altogether was when we sold all of our Pakistani holdings when the central bank stealthily imposed capital controls in 2001.\n\nWhile events in Russia are causing angst and forcing us to watch the situation very carefully, we are not yet close to having to take extreme measures. It\u2019s time to be afraid, but not very afraid.\n\nauthoritarian regimes tend to fail in the medium to longer term for a very simple reason \u2013 every petty official from the president on down acquires the ability to be capricious or corrupt without fear of consequences, and frequently chooses to use that power to further their own personal interests. We saw proof of this concept in late December when a senior official within the telecommunication ministry tried (but ultimately failed) to levy punitive back taxes on the cellular carrier Vimplecom. It turns out that this official is affiliated with a major shareholder of one of Vimplecom\u2019s competitors.\n\nHowever, internal affairs within Russia are not the only cause for concern. Recent events in Ukraine also raise the prospect that Russia is on a collision course with the West over what it sees as encroachment onto its home turf.\n\nHaving owned and backed the wrong candidate in the recent election, Mr. Putin may be behind by a couple of goals, but make no mistake, it\u2019s only the first period in a game that has no ending. And, if the sordid history of Yukos is any guide, Mr. Putin is not a leader lightly scorned. Given that Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its natural gas (a number that will rise, not fall, in coming years) and that 80% of that gas transits through Ukraine, Russia holds a number of very significant cards in this game. One can see Mr. Putin using these cards to pull Ukraine back into the Russian fold \u2013 which will exacerbate tensions with the West.\n\nFinally, Russia has started to make overtures to China, India, and Iran \u2013 offering them a stake in future energy ventures along with advanced military weaponry, with the explicit goal of driving a wedge between them and the US.\n\nAll these factors increase risks for Western minority investors in Russia.\n\nWhile this kind of speculation makes for good cocktail party chatter, we are in the position of having to make\nGMO Emerging Thoughts\nThe Empire Strikes Back, January 2005",

While fear and intimidation may have worked in the olden days (when players were cowards and referees were biased), today\u2019s game is played by much more courageous athletes who have little respect for intimidation and will retaliate with equal (or greater) intimidation. We saw this dynamic play out in the recent \u201cHe\u2019s Okay\u201d saga \u2013 the Raiders\u2019 intimidation did not work, and the Broncos\u2019 courageous response (without spitting or throwing punches) caused the Raiders to back down and respect the Broncos\u2019 courage.

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nDimson and Marsh Revisited\n\nWhat D&M Did:\nDimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country\u2011picking strategies for EM, from 1976\u20112013. Figure\u202f1 shows their results for equal\u2011weighted portfolios.\n\nThere are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn \u2013 first, that value works (they use Div\u202fYield as the proxy for value) to predict one\u2011year return. Second, that reversion strategies work \u2013 countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5\u202fyears. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12\u2011month local real return) don\u2019t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5\u202fyears GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1\u202fyear return.\n\nWhat We Did:\nFirst of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money.\n\nFigure\u202f2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993\u20112013. The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes.\n\nFigure\u202f3 shows the same study, but now using square\u2011root market\u2011cap to define the quintiles and market\u2011cap weighting within each quintile. Again the results don\u2019t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts).\n\nSince we think of value as being something different from Div\u202fYield, we re\u2011ran the equal\u2011weighted analysis replacing Div\u202fYield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure\u202f4 shows the results \u2013 clearly earnings yield works even better than Div\u202fYield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone.\n\nDisentangling the effects:\nLooking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value \u2013 after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap.\n\nIn order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12\u2011month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value.\n\nTable\u202f1 shows the T\u2011stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non\u2011overlapping periods).\n\n| Variable | T\u2011Stat | Adjusted R\u00b2 |\n|---|---|---|\n| DivYld | 4.57 | 4.8% |\n| Yield and Country Size | 4.71 | 1.38 |\n| Yield and Trailing 12\u202fMonth Return | 4.31 | \u20133.28 |\n| Yield and Currency Return | 4.54 | \u20132.34 |\n| Yield and Past 5\u202fYr GDP Growth | 4.47 | \u20130.96 |\n| Yield and Future 5\u202fYr GDP Growth | 5.06 | 3.78 |\n\nThe one clear conclusion is that Past 5\u202fYr GDP growth is a proxy for value \u2013 adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T\u2011stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don\u2019t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return.",

He is extremely plugged in with the financial elite and serves on a number of government advisory boards. He told a very convincing story about how things were going to play out in China over the next few years, and which sectors would benefit. However, at the end of the discussion, it occurred to me that the entirety of his story depended on government policy and actions.\n\nIn my travels around India over the last couple of weeks, I had multiple discussions with business and financial leaders about what is likely to happen in India over the next few years. None of their thoughts depended on government action. If anything, their main fear was that government intervention/inaction was the thing most likely to slow down or kill the huge growth momentum that exists today.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the relative case for China vs. India. China succeeds if the government gets it right; India succeeds if the government gets out of the way. Both could happen. Or neither. In both cases, long\u2011term return to investors will depend not so much on the success or failure of the country in GDP terms, but on the ability of companies to deliver high return on capital. So, what drives return on capital?\n\nOne of my colleagues at GMO has written about the problems of overcapacity in China (see \u201cChina\u2019s Red Flags\u201d by Edward Chancellor) so I won\u2019t spend time on it, but one thing is clear to me: building overcapacity is generally good for the consumer and bad for the producer. Thus, building multiple high\u2011speed rail lines in China almost certainly improves the quality of life for the average Chinese, but it is inconceivable that the return on capital on those rail lines will be high, in pure financial terms. If it were, the U.S. would surely have built plenty of high\u2011speed rail lines by now. After all, the ability of the U.S. consumer to pay for transportation is considerably higher than that of the Chinese consumer. The fact that no high\u2011speed rail lines exist in the U.S. tells you something about the potential return on capital on high\u2011speed rail in expansive continental geographies.\n\nIn short, overcapacity may lead to high social return, but almost certainly leads to low return on invested capital.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at India through this lens. In India (mainly due to poor government policy and implementation) everything is in short supply \u2013 too few roads, bridges, ports, educated people, etc. Thus, people have difficult lives, but it turns out that the average return on capital in corporate India is one of the highest of any country in the world (and has been for the last 10 years).\n\nThe one area in India that has overcapacity is mobile phones. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s the one policy the government actually got right \u2013 by allowing unfettered competition (and giving away 2G licenses for a song). As you may guess, none of the mobile phone companies are making much money because mobile rates are the lowest in the world. In fact, the largest mobile phone company is trying to grow profits by investing in telecoms outside of India. This is what makes for the true irony of India \u2013 that bad policy has led to high profits because producers benefitted from shortages.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of bad policy\u2011making (India consistently runs high budget deficits) is the high cost of capital. This forces producers to invest only in high\u2011return projects (so as to be above their cost of capital) and benefits investors by delivering high return on investment.\n\nNow this sounds like a contradiction for investors like us \u2013 is it possible that investing in India benefits from bad policy in the long run? And, if so, should we not invest heavily in countries that have bad governments rather than good ones? Or, maybe one should focus on countries where the local cost of capital is high? Brazil is another high\u2011cost\u2011of\u2011capital country that has produced high dollar returns despite mediocre economic growth.\n\nI believe that sooner or later, the lack of infrastructure/education will start to bite and constrain India\u2019s ability to grow. We already see inflation picking up in India, as rising incomes are not matched by rising food production, rising salaries are not matched by rising educational quality, and rising commodity prices are not ameliorated by better infrastructure. High inflation will eat away at the ability of companies to sustain high margins, and markets usually demand a discount from high\u2011inflation countries. Bottom line, one should not expect bad governance to lead to permanent positive payoffs.\n\nNevertheless, India has one considerable advantage from my point of view: its business model is based on bottom\u2011up capitalism. Of course, anything is possible in the short run, but it seems inconceivable to me that state\u2011directed investment policies could produce sustainable higher return on capital than those chosen by individual profit\u2011maximizers.\n\nIn the final analysis, one needs to make the distinction not only between countries, but between companies and sectors based on their ability to produce and sustain high profitability rather than on simple metrics like GDP, which have very little to do with making money as investors.\n\nIn short, don\u2019t focus on growth. Focus on profitability. Obviously, as value investors, the single most important thing we look at is valuation \u2013 we are willing to pay a premium for profitability, but not to overpay for it.\n\nCurrent positioning. At this point in time (January 2011), we are heavily underweight both India and China in our Emerging Markets Strategy, due primarily to high valuations in both countries relative to other emerging markets. In addition, in both countries, the central banks appear to be behind the curve and they will have to act strongly to bring inflation down, a task that is made much harder by the proliferate monetary policies of the developed markets, particularly the U.S.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed herein are those of Arjun Divecha and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\n**A Model to Understand Risk and Return**\n\nTo analyze risk and return, the authors develop a multi\u2011factor model similar to that used for developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f[1989]). The model hierarchically decomposes portfolio excess return (return beyond the risk\u2011free rate) into currency return, local excess return, and a cross\u2011product term. Equation\u202f(1) expresses excess numeraire return as:\n\n    Excess Numeraire Return = (Currency Return) \u2013 (Local Excess Return) + (Cross\u2011Product)\n\nwhere the currency return captures exchange\u2011rate effects and interest\u2011rate differentials, the local excess return reflects the asset\u2019s performance in its home market, and the cross\u2011product term (r_c \u00d7 r_l) is usually small and can be ignored for most markets. However, for Argentina and Brazil the cross\u2011product is material (changing annual risk by 17\u202f% and 4\u202f% respectively), so the authors model these assets directly in U.S. dollars rather than decomposing them.\n\nLocal excess return is further broken into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk\u2011index return (size, earnings\u2011to\u2011price, liquidity, etc.). Exposures to country factors are measured by betas to the market of each country; industry exposures use the Financial Times World\u2011Wide (FTWW) classification; risk\u2011index exposures are normalized within each country.\n\nThe model was estimated for assets from 23 emerging markets (February\u202f1986\u202f\u2013\u202fJuly\u202f1991) using data from the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources. The adjusted R\u00b2 for the full emerging\u2011markets model is 50\u202f%, compared with 38\u202f% for a comparable developed\u2011markets model. Two sub\u2011models help explain this difference:\n\n1. **Industry\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Industry Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 16\u202f% for emerging markets versus 22\u202f% for developed markets, indicating weaker cross\u2011country industry integration in emerging markets.\n\n2. **Country\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 46\u202f% for emerging markets versus 30\u202f% for developed markets, showing that country\u2011specific forces dominate emerging\u2011market returns.\n\n**Homogeneity within markets**\n\nThe large country\u2011factor contribution implies that stock returns within a given emerging market are more homogeneous than in developed markets. Even when stocks are equally weighted, the R\u00b2 remains high (42\u202f% vs. 29\u202f% for developed markets). The authors explore three possible explanations:\n\n* **Concentration effect** \u2013 a few large stocks dominate market capitalization.\n* **True homogeneity** \u2013 stocks move together regardless of size.\n* **Volatility\u2011driven R\u00b2** \u2013 higher market volatility inflates the explanatory power of the market factor.\n\nExhibit\u202f3 shows that most emerging markets are indeed more concentrated than developed markets, but the difference is modest. Asset\u2011concentration scores (a measure ranging from 0 for perfectly equal weights to 1 for total concentration) average around 0.13 for the larger emerging markets, compared with 0.08 for the U.S. market. Sector\u2011concentration scores are similarly modest; only a few small markets (e.g., Jordan, Nigeria) exhibit high sector concentration.\n\nWhen concentration is controlled for, the average unweighted correlation of monthly stock returns within each market remains higher for emerging markets (e.g., Taiwan 0.77, Brazil 0.70) than for developed markets (U.S. 0.49, Japan 0.46). This suggests a dominant market\u2011wide force that overwhelms industry differentials.\n\n**Heterogeneity across markets**\n\nIn contrast, emerging markets are weakly correlated with each other. Exhibit\u202f4 reports average pairwise correlations of only 0.07 over the five\u2011year sample, with many negative pairings (89 of 276 correlations are negative). The authors attribute this to limited trade links and restrictive foreign\u2011participation rules that insulated markets from one another. As globalization progresses, they expect these correlations to rise.\n\nBy comparison, developed markets exhibit an average correlation of 0.49 (Exhibit\u202f5), and the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the FT World Index is 0.35.\n\nThese findings have direct portfolio implications: low cross\u2011market correlations provide diversification benefits, while high within\u2011market homogeneity means that country selection, rather than stock picking, drives active returns in emerging markets.",
      "model_response": "The authors then apply the model to data for U.S. stocks from 1988 to 1991 (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f[1995, 1996]). The results show that the average annual return on U.S. stocks over this period was 13.1\u202f%, with volatility (annualized standard deviation) of 16.1\u202f%. The one\u2011year return correlation across stocks was 0.91, indicating that stock returns were highly correlated over the period. The authors decompose the return variance into three components: country factor variance, active manager variance, and idiosyncratic (stock\u2011specific) variance.\n\nThe country factor is modeled as a single factor, with loadings that reflect the relative size of each country in the world portfolio. The average country factor loading was 0.65, implying that 42\u202f% (0.65\u00b2\u00d7100) of the return variance was due to the country factor. The remaining 58\u202f% was attributed to active management and idiosyncratic returns. The average size of active management effects was 11.1\u202f% return per year, with volatility of 6.4\u202f%, leading to a T\u202f=\u202f4 annual return series for active managers. The average bet on value showed a negative alpha of \u20131.",

      "training_answer": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nA nice idea, but does it work?\\nWe tested out this idea to see how it would have worked over the past five years. To make this a realistic strategy, we used a simple constraint: that each country's weight had to range from 50% to 200% of its market capitalization weight. This ensures that each country will have a weight that is reasonable and investable for the global investor. We chose the numbers, 50% and 200%, quite arbitrarily; for an actual investment the range should probably be tailored to the investability of each country and the risk aversion of the investor.\\n\\nWe used the following methodology to construct the portfolios:\\n1) We chose from all the countries in the IFC Global Composite Index except for Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, and Indonesia. We deemed all of these (except for Indonesia for which adequate data was not available) to be uninvestable and/or uninteresting to the global investor.\\n2) We used the monthly total return, in U.S. dollars, to each market from January 1985 to December 1987 (36 months) to form the first variance\u2011covariance matrix. Using this matrix and quadratic optimization, we found the LV portfolio for January 1988 that met our constraint of 50% to 200% of market weight for each country.\\n3) We held this portfolio for 12 months, until the end of 1988.\\n4) We repeated steps 2 and 3 for each year from 1989 through 1992. At each year\u2011end, we used the previous five years of data to compute the matrix (except for 1988, when only four years were available).\\n5) We then computed the return, in U.S. dollars, to the LV strategy and the IFC Global Index between January 1988 and December 1992.\\n\\nAnd the winner is \u2026\\n\\nExhibit 2 shows the results of the simulation. The LV portfolio did indeed have lower volatility than the IFC index, as expected. The finding that the LV portfolio outperformed the IFC index over the same time period is somewhat surprising. This would imply that the IFC index was almost certainly not MV efficient over this period\u2014a further nail in the capitalization\u2011weighting coffin.\\n\\nWe find that the realized volatility (annualized standard deviation of monthly returns) of the LV portfolio over this five\u2011year period was 16.54%, compared to 23.39% for the IFC index. Exhibit 3 shows the 24\u2011month rolling volatility over this time period; clearly, the LV portfolio had lower realized volatility than the IFC index over the entire time span. The results show that such an LV strategy would indeed have worked over the past five years. In our opinion, one can make a strong case for viewing the LV weights as the baseline for performance evaluation.\\n\\nMore is better\\nThe analysis thus far has focused on how to weight the emerging markets among themselves. Now let's examine the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a global investor's portfolio. Exhibit 4 shows the impact of adding the LV portfolio to a global portfolio. The choice of capitalization weights or LV weights doesn't seem to make much difference up to weights of 10% in the emerging markets, but the impact is quite dramatic after that. The strategy clearly leads to much greater risk reduction than the capitalization\u2011weighted IFC Index. Additionally, whereas the lowest volatility of the IFC\u2011FT mix is at approximately a 20% level of investment in emerging markets, the lowest risk point of the LV\u2011FT mix is with an investment of between 40\u201150% in the emerging markets. Thus, using this methodology strengthens an already strong case for investments in the emerging markets.\\n\\nBut wait, there's more\u2026\\nStill further risk reduction is possible. The current optimization computed country weights for the LV portfolio based on minimizing risk within the emerging markets, and I then used the LV portfolio as a single asset when combined with the world portfolio. Even further risk reductions would have resulted if the optimization to pick country weights had taken into account the investor's existing mix of countries and asset classes.\\n\\nThe early bird gets the worm\\nThis significant risk reduction occurs primarily because emerging markets are uncorrelated to each other and to developed markets. These correlations will undoubtedly rise as economic and trade links increase among the emerging countries and the developed countries. As this happens, the \"diversification free lunch\" currently being served will diminish. Indulge while the opportunity exists!\\n\\nTo conclude: modest investments in an emerging markets index fund would reduce the overall portfolio risk of a global investor; larger investments in a LV emerging market portfolio would lead to further risk reduction.\\n\\nFootnotes\\n1 Divecha, Drach and Stefek, 1992, Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective, Journal of Portfolio Management, Fall 1992, p. 41\u201156\\n2 Haugen, R.A. \"Building a better index\", Pensions and Investment Age, October 1,1990, p 56.\\n3 Vangelisti, Marco \"High Return\u2011Low Risk: A Dream Come True?\", Barra Newsletter, #139, November/December 1991, p. 1; and \"Minimum\u2011Variance Strategies: Do They Work?\", Barra Newsletter, #140, January/February 1992, p. 1.",
      "model_response": "Related Topics: Market analysis\n\nA nice idea, but does it work?\nWe tested out this idea to see how it would have worked over the past five years. To make this a realistic strategy, we used a simple constraint: that each country's weight had to range from 0 to 100%, with the sum of all the country weights equal to 100%. We chose the parameters that would have minimized the maximum drawdown over the five\u2011year period while satisfying the other constraints. The resulting portfolio would have had a maximum drawdown of 8.5% (so that the percentage of each country's weight did not fall below zero) and would have tracked very closely with the MSCI World ex\u2011China index. The optimized portfolio weights are shown in Exhibit\u202f7.\n\nExhibit\u202f8 shows how this optimized portfolio would have done over the past five years. The top\u2011down approach would have added value in a cyclical environment such as the past five years, with strong economic growth in emerging markets (EM) spilling over into developed markets (DM). The secondary benefit of the EM\u2011only strategy would have been to reduce the risk of a head\u2011wind in the U.S. market should the economic peak in India and China not have materialized.\n\nWhat are the implications for the near future?\nThe question we should all ask ourselves is whether the peak in Chinese and Indian economic activity has actually materialized or is still out there somewhere in the future",
