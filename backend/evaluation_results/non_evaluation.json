The narrative stresses that the U.S.\u2013China \u201cEconomic War\u201d is a long\u2011run battle over technology, military power, and ideology, and that the combined weight of Taiwan and China represents roughly half of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, creating a negative net effect for that asset class. Memories of Covid\u201119 disruptions and climate\u2011change\u2011induced shocks further motivate diversification. The slide concludes that there is no single \u201cone\u2011stop\u201d alternative to China; instead, on\u2011shoring, near\u2011shoring, and friend\u2011shoring each present distinct investment opportunities, with the presenter focusing on the latter two.\n\nSlide\u202f3 asks why China has fallen out of favor, listing six factors: (1) demographics \u2013 labor\u2011force growth has turned negative after the one\u2011child policy; (2) capitalism \u2013 Deng\u2019s market\u2011opening reforms are being rolled back under Xi; (3) access to global markets \u2013 once expanded by Nixon\u2019s opening and WTO membership, now constrained by Western restrictions; (4) competence \u2013 decision\u2011making has shifted from collective mandarins to a more centralized Xi; (5) Covid\u201119; (6) \u201cKilling the golden geese,\u201d a metaphor for policy missteps that erode China\u2019s competitive advantage; plus housing issues and the \u201cbiggest failure of all \u2013",

      "training_answer": "How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework?\nLast year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top\u2011down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables \u2013 our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean\u2011reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon \u2013 Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12\u2011month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account/GDP (which we\u2019ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money\u2011supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value.\n\nFigure\u202f5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999\u20112013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each sub\u2011component would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12\u2011month forward returns.\n\nFigure\u202f6 shows the same m\u2011cap weighted results.\n\nOverall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand\u2011alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T\u2011stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey\u2011West T\u2011stats, which (I\u2019m told) correct for the serial correlation.\n\nTable\u202f2 \u2013 Earnings Yield alone:\nBeta = 3.75, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 7.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 12.01.\n\nTable\u202f3 \u2013 Macro alone (normalized to one sigma):\nBeta = 10.47, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 1.1\u202f%, T\u2011Stat = 6.37. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor.\n\nTable\u202f4 \u2013 Combined model:\nEarnings Yield Beta = 3.71, Macro Beta = 9.74, Adjusted R\u2011Squared = 8.0\u202f%, T\u2011Stats = 11.86 (Earnings Yield) and 6.27 (Macro).\n\nThe combined regression shows that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone.\n\nConclusions:\n\u2022 D&M\u2019s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth.\n\u2022 We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past.\n\u2022 The finding that countries with poor GDP growth over the past 5\u202fyears outperform was simply an artifact of those countries being cheaper; the fallen\u2011currency effect and the future\u2011GDP effect remain strong after adjusting for value.\n\u2022 Using sliced PE performed better than dividend yield.\n\u2022 Our new macro model works on a stand\u2011alone basis and, more importantly, represents a genuine enhancement to our value\u2011based country\u2011picking process.\n\nEvelyn Huang\nArjun Divecha\n\nINTERNAL ONLY: Not for external distribution",

The San Francisco 49ers could certainly use a deep\u2011pocketed owner. Yo! Potanin, over here!\n\nIn short, Mr. Putin intends to have complete control of all levels of political and economic activity. It is telling that the only dissenting voice to speak up is that of his own maverick economic advisor Andrei Illarionov who said, \u201cThe sale of Yuganskneftegaz to a mystical, and now not so mystical, company named Baikal Finance Group has won this year\u2019s \u2018shady deal\u2019 of the year award.\u201d While Mr. Putin has ignored the free\u2011speaking Illarionov\u2019s inflammatory comments in the past, it will be interesting to see how he will react to this outburst.\n\nIf Mr. Putin succeeds in creating this new paradigm of government\u2011sponsored capitalism (and I believe that in the short run, he very well might), my fear is that he will create a new model for development that will be detrimental to minority shareholders such as ourselves, not just in Russia, but elsewhere as well.\n\nSo will he succeed? With high oil prices, a reduced foreign debt load, and massive foreign exchange reserves, there are no dark clouds on the horizon. While recent economic growth has been extremely dependent on high oil prices, we have started to see the beginnings of a consumer society that could fuel growth for the next few years.\n\nLooking at the history of other authoritarian regimes, one sees that they tend to succeed in their early phases \u2013 what I call the Bill Parcells\u00b9 effect \u2013 that intimidation does \u2026\n\nEleven years ago, GMO\u2019s Annual Client Conference (soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union), I said I believed we were living in a golden age of capitalism. With communism and socialism having been so thoroughly and comprehensively discredited, there was only one competing paradigm for economic development \u2013 that of free and open markets and privatization of government owned companies, rather than nationalization and central planning. It was based on this shift that I made my long\u2011term case for investing in emerging markets (although from a short\u2011term point of view, October 1993 did not represent particularly good timing on my part).\n\nI also said that I did not believe that this golden age would last forever, that former socialists/authoritarians had not suddenly turned into committed free\u2011traders, but were biding their time and would surely make a re\u2011appearance some day, selling the same old vodka in new bottles.\n\nThat day may now have arrived in Russia.\n\nIn my opinion, Mr. Putin is trying to create a model of the modern authoritarian state where private corporations and government owned/controlled entities both serve some greater \u201cnational good\u201d in addition to attempting to enrich their shareholders.\n\nThe Yukos case serves as a multi\u2011pronged attempt in attaining this goal. On one hand, it is perhaps the first step in reversing some of the privatizations of the early 90s and to establish a \u201cnational energy company\u201d \u2013 a government controlled energy giant that would play in the same league as OPEC. While economic reasons play a role, the primary motivation is to serve Russia\u2019s geopolitical goals. In a post 9/11 world of energy insecurity, Russia\u2019s energy assets have more strategic clout than their nuclear missiles.\n\nAnother aspect is to send a very clear signal to Mr. Khodorkovsky and his fellow oligarchs that companies \u2026",

Figure\u202f7 (Exhibit\u202f7) illustrates the risk\u2011return trade\u2011off of mixing the IFC Emerging Markets Index with the FT World Index over the five\u2011year period ending March\u202f1991. Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest. As emerging markets develop stronger financial and trade links with the rest of the world, correlations are expected to increase, eroding this free lunch.\n\nBecause of the high within\u2011market homogeneity, active managers should focus on **country selection** rather than intensive stock picking. The larger impact of country selection is evident in the higher volatility and return dispersion across countries.

Coupled with diversification benefits, the case for adding emerging\u2011market exposure to a global portfolio is compelling.\n\n**Endnotes & References**\n\nThe paper cites sources such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook\u202f1991,\u201d Brown\u202f(1991), Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f(1989), and Roll\u202f(1990).

The text ends mid-sentence, so I need to complete the thought.\n\nFirst, I should understand the context. The previous paragraph discusses how active managers should focus on country selection rather than stock picking because of the high homogeneity within markets. The sentence is cut off at \"low-tracking-error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuable...\" So, the continuation should elaborate on the importance of constructing low-tracking-error baskets, perhaps discussing the benefits, methods, or implications of such strategies.\n\nI need to make sure the continuation is in line with the previous analysis. The key points from the previous text are:\n- Diversification benefits of emerging markets, especially with modest allocations.\n- The \"diversification free lunch\" concept.\n- Country selection is more important than stock picking.\n- Constructing low-tracking-error baskets that mimic indices is valuable.\n\nSo, the continuation should explain why constructing such baskets is valuable, maybe by discussing how they help in capturing market returns efficiently, the challenges involved, or the impact on portfolio performance. Also, the text mentions that as correlations increase, the free lunch disappears, so maybe the continuation should touch on that, or the implications of the current environment for portfolio construction.\n\nI should also check for any terms or phrases that need",

      "training_answer": "\u201cDude, Where\u2019s My Alpha?\u201d\n\nOver the last four years we\u2019ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets \u2013 both cheap countries and cheap stocks. As a result, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks have narrowed. Because we are primarily value investors, that narrowing would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short\u2011to\u2011medium term.\n\n**Country Selection \u2013 How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries?**\n\nChart\u202f1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive ones. In normal times cheap countries trade at 78\u202f% of the valuation of expensive countries \u2013 a 22\u202f% discount. Right now that discount has narrowed to 15\u202f%. Does that mean cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount two years ago and value worked very well for country selection since then. By contrast, when they were at similar valuations in mid\u20111998 (the latter half of the Asian crisis) cheap countries suffered their worst relative under\u2011performance over the next twelve months.\n\nWhat this means, in our view, is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.\n\n**What Are We Doing About It?**\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that while value is an important part of our country\u2011selection discipline (45\u202f% weight in our country\u2011assessment model), it is not the only metric we use. Momentum, macro\u2011economics and judgment form the remaining 55\u202f% and we have no evidence that they are poorly positioned to deliver out\u2011performance right now. Our work on currency vulnerability also shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of contagion.\n\nWe normally run our country\u2011selection process at a tracking\u2011error of around 8\u202f%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking the tracking\u2011error down from 8\u202f% to about 6\u202f%. Consequently, our current overweight of Brazil will fall from 9.5\u202f% to roughly 7\u202f%, with similar adjustments across all country positions.\n\nThese actions reflect a shift from pure value\u2011driven country bets to a more balanced approach that still respects the 45\u202f% value component but gives greater weight to momentum, macro and judgment. The overall intent is to protect the portfolio from the heightened risk that the narrowing spread now represents while preserving the upside that still exists in cheap\u2011country exposure.",

Investors are reacting: a large sovereign\u2011wealth fund reduced overall EM exposure; Texas Teachers Pension announced it will cut China weight in half; a large endowment is shifting China weight by investing in GMO EM ex\u2011China fund. The growing weight of China mirrors the Japan\u2011in\u2011EAFE issue of the 1980s.\n\nSlide 4 \u2013 Index weight\nChina + Taiwan represent 45.5% of the MSCI EM index; China alone is 31.0%. China A\u2011Shares are only 20% of their market value in the index; full inclusion would raise China A\u2011Shares from 5% to 22% of MSCI.\n\nSlide 5 \u2013 Country\u2011level concentration\nHerfindahl\u2011Hirschman Index (HHI) shows a very lopsided portfolio when China/Taiwan dominate the EM index.\n\nSlide 6 \u2013 Cap weighting positives\nMarket\u2011cap weighting aligns with liquidity. Example: Alvaro\u2019s fund grew from $3\u202fbn to $10\u202fbn under cap weighting.\n\nSlide 7 \u2013 Equal weighting trade\u2011offs\nEqual weighting solves concentration but creates other issues; the same Alvaro example is cited.\n\nSlide 8 \u2013 Square\u2011root cap weighting\nA compromise: square\u2011root market\u2011cap weighting balances liquidity and concentration concerns.\n\nSlide 9 \u2013 The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio concept\nNot an index \u2013 construction involves judgment. Ideal features: focus on country weights, cap\u2011weight stocks within each country for liquidity, intuitive \u201csmell test\u201d, smaller China/Taiwan exposure emerging naturally, no single country or tightly correlated group dominates, multiple risk and opportunity dimensions considered.\n\nSlide 10 \u2013 Factors to consider in the \u201cNew Normal\u201d\n\nSlide 11\u201113 \u2013 Demographics\nBigger populations are better, but labor\u2011market dynamics matter. China\u2019s one\u2011child policy led to a peak in 2010; its labor force is now shrinking. India\u2019s demographics will peak around 2030 with a still\u2011expanding labor force. Dependency ratios illustrate these trends.\n\nSlide 14\u201115 \u2013 Climate\nClimate risk is rising. It\u2019s not just vulnerability; it\u2019s also the ability to respond. Taiwan is vulnerable to sea\u2011level rise but can build sea walls; Bangladesh cannot.

The \u201cNew Normal\u201d portfolio is neither a traditional index nor an active portfolio but a new way of thinking about sensible EM investing. Multiple factors matter; combining them is an art, not a science. The resulting portfolio is comfortable for long\u2011term ownership with minimal turnover. Bottom line: the \u201cNew Normal\u201d is a better way to invest in EM.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve been asked by a number of our clients whether the anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue \u2013 the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nAt this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets, and thus most multinationals do not represent a \u201cpure play\u201d on emerging domestic demand.\n\nFor example, if we screen the MSCI World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50\u202f% of their sales from emerging markets, we find 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574\u202fbillion and make up only 2.1\u202f% of the market value of the MSCI World Index (see Exhibit\u202f6 for the ten largest companies in this group \u2013 not exactly the household names one expects to see).\n\nIn addition, locally\u2011domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home\u2011field advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well\u2011established local brands, government policies that tend to favour locals, and the fact that local competitors often have high profitability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend \u2013 rather than build \u2013 their market share.\n\nA good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia would be extremely expensive. Moreover, they would face great difficulty competing against a well\u2011established player such as Magnit, which runs more than 4,000 stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20\u202f%. We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where it paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multin",
      "training_answer": "ationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\nWe have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global ri",
      "training_answer": "vals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",

The original text is about the shift in investment focus within emerging markets, moving from exporters and commodity producers to domestic demand sectors. The user's last sentence was cut off, so I need to complete that thought.\n\nFirst, I should understand the context. The analysis is arguing that domestic demand sectors in emerging markets are more attractive because they are less correlated with global economic conditions. The previous part mentioned that exporters and commodity producers are more correlated with developed market growth, which is uncertain. So the continuation should elaborate on why domestic demand is better, perhaps by discussing the resilience of domestic markets, the role of consumption and infrastructure, and maybe examples or data to support this.\n\nI need to make sure the continuation flows naturally from the last sentence. The original text was cut off at \"global ri\" which might be a typo, perhaps \"global rivals\"? So the user is saying that for exporters to do well, they need to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are squeezed by global rivals. So the continuation should explain the challenges for exporters, then contrast that with the opportunities in domestic demand.\n\nI should mention the factors that make domestic demand sectors resilient, such of as growing middle class, government investment in infrastructure, and the shift in consumption patterns.

Thus, one of the fringe benefits of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long\u2011standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profitability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally\u2011listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade\u2011off between \u201cpure\u2011play\u201d and valuation. Domino\u2019s Pizza, for instance, has a market cap of $1.6\u202fbillion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3\u202fbillion, despite contributing less than 10\u202f% of sales and 18\u202f% of profits of the overall company.\n\nIf our thesis of home\u2011field advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past five years. Exhibit\u202f7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit\u202f8, however, shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason for the outperformance is that earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion.\n\nThe key takeaway is that it is not about multinationals versus locals, but about which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. At the country level, nations with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Within those countries, sectors with favourable competitive structures \u2013 high barriers to entry, oligopolistic dynamics, strong brand franchises \u2013 are the most promising. Financial services in India, for example, benefit from low credit\u2011card penetration (only about 2\u202f% of the population) and a highly profitable banking sector, whereas Indian telecom, despite massive subscriber growth, suffers from intense competition that depresses profitability.\n\nIn GMO parlance \u2013 focus on quality within fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations \u2013 the winners will likely be well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing markets.",

      "question": "Continue this investment analysis:\n\n**A Model to Understand Risk and Return**\n\nTo analyze risk and return, the authors develop a multi\u2011factor model similar to that used for developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f[1989]). The model hierarchically decomposes portfolio excess return (return beyond the risk\u2011free rate) into currency return, local excess return, and a cross\u2011product term. Equation\u202f(1) expresses excess numeraire return as:\n\n    Excess Numeraire Return = (Currency Return) \u2013 (Local Excess Return) + (Cross\u2011Product)\n\nwhere the currency return captures exchange\u2011rate effects and interest\u2011rate differentials, the local excess return reflects the asset\u2019s performance in its home market, and the cross\u2011product term (r_c \u00d7 r_l) is usually small and can be ignored for most markets. However, for Argentina and Brazil the cross\u2011product is material (changing annual risk by 17\u202f% and 4\u202f% respectively), so the authors model these assets directly in U.S. dollars rather than decomposing them.\n\nLocal excess return is further broken into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk\u2011index return (size, earnings\u2011to\u2011price, liquidity, etc.). Exposures to country factors are measured by betas to the market of each country; industry exposures use the Financial Times World\u2011Wide (FTWW) classification; risk\u2011index exposures are normalized within each country.\n\nThe model was estimated for assets from 23 emerging markets (February\u202f1986\u202f\u2013\u202fJuly\u202f1991) using data from the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources. The adjusted R\u00b2 for the full emerging\u2011markets model is 50\u202f%, compared with 38\u202f% for a comparable developed\u2011markets model. Two sub\u2011models help explain this difference:\n\n1. **Industry\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Industry Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 16\u202f% for emerging markets versus 22\u202f% for developed markets, indicating weaker cross\u2011country industry integration in emerging markets.\n\n2. **Country\u2011only model** (Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return) yields an adjusted R\u00b2 of 46\u202f% for emerging markets versus 30\u202f% for developed markets, showing that country\u2011specific forces dominate emerging\u2011market returns.\n\n**Homogeneity within markets**\n\nThe large cou",
      "training_answer": "ntry\u2011factor contribution implies that stock returns within a given emerging market are more homogeneous than in developed markets. Even when stocks are equally weighted, the R\u00b2 remains high (42\u202f% vs. 29\u202f% for developed markets). The authors explore three possible explanations:\n\n* **Concentration effect** \u2013 a few large stocks dominate market capitalization.\n* **True homogeneity** \u2013 stocks move together regardless of size.\n* **Volatility\u2011driven R\u00b2** \u2013 higher market volatility inflates the explanatory power of the market factor.\n\nExhibit\u202f3 shows that most emerging markets are indeed more concentrated than developed markets, but the difference is modest. Asset\u2011concentration scores (a measure ranging from 0 for perfectly equal weights to 1 for total concentration) average around 0.13 for the larger emerging markets, compared with 0.08 for the U.S. market. Sector\u2011concentration scores are similarly modest; only a few small markets (e.g., Jordan, Nigeria) exhibit high sector concentration.\n\nWhen concentration is controlled for, the average unweighted correlation of monthly stock returns within each market remains higher for emerging markets (e.g., Taiwan 0.77, Brazil 0.70) than for developed markets (U.S. 0.49, Japan 0.46). This suggests a dominant market\u2011wide force that overwhelms industry differentials.\n\n**Heterogeneity across markets**\n\nIn contrast, emerging markets are weakly correlated with each other. Exhibit\u202f4 reports average pairwise correlations of only 0.07 over the five\u2011year sample, with many negative pairings (89 of 276 correlations are negative). The authors attribute this to limited trade links and restrictive foreign\u2011participation rules that insulated markets from one another. As globalization progresses, they expect these correlations to rise.\n\nBy comparison, developed markets exhibit an average correlation of 0.49 (Exhibit\u202f5), and the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the FT World Index is 0.35.\n\nThese findings have direct portfolio implications: low cross\u2011market correlations provide diversification benefits, while high within\u2011market homogeneity means that country selection, rather than stock picking, drives active returns in emerging markets.",

Our country selection process has four elements \u2013 three based on objective, quantitative data and one based on our judgment, which represents 10% of the overall assessment of a country.\n\nCurrently, the quantitative parts of the model are quite negative on Russia, with a combined score of -0.9 (which is quite negative). While the market is relatively cheap (based on high oil company profits) our momentum and macroeconomic models are quite negative. This negative score translates into a moderately large underweighting relative to the benchmark.\n\nGiven the risks I\u2019ve talked about, it makes sense that we should have a negative judgment on Russia. If we were to assess a score of -1.0 on our judgment, the overall score for Russia would fall to -1.2 and our underweighting would increase by 1/2 a percent.\n\nWere the quantitative parts of the model to turn positive over the coming months, we would increase our weight in Russia, recognizing that our judgment serves as a drag on how much we buy, but does not override it.\n\nWould we override the entire process and get out of Russia altogether? Yes, in an extreme circumstance. However, these kinds of systemic overrides are few and far between. The last time we chose to get out a country altogether was when we sold all of our Pakistani holdings when the central bank stealthily imposed capital controls in 2001.\n\nWhile events in Russia are causing angst and forc",

Given that Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its natural gas (a number that will rise, not fall, in coming years) and that 80% of that gas transits through Ukraine, Russia holds a number of very significant cards in this game. One can see Mr. Putin using these cards to pull Ukraine back into the Russian fold \u2013 which will exacerbate tensions with the West.\n\nFinally, Russia has started to make overtures to China, India, and Iran \u2013 offering them a stake in future energy ventures along with advanced military weaponry, with the explicit goal of driving a wedge between them and the US.\n\nAll these factors increase risks for Western minority investors in Russia.\n\nWhile this kind of speculation makes for good cocktail party chatter, we are in the position of having to make\nGMO Emerging Thoughts\nThe Empire Strikes Back, January 2005",

      "training_answer": "We have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export\u2011oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets.\n\nIn the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4\u202ftrillion and daily trading volume of around $40\u202fbillion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets.\n\nWhile there are many ways to segment emerging markets \u2013 by region, big\u2011cap vs. small\u2011cap, value vs. growth \u2013 we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure.\n\nFrom this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalised world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a \u201cseven\u2011lean\u2011years\u201d scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a \u201cpure play\u201d on the economic growth of these countries.\n\nLooking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors, and margins are likely to be squeezed by well\u2011capitalised global rivals.\n\nThe main case for the domestic\u2011demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confluence of two forces: economics and demographics.\n\n**The Economic Case**\nThe economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging\u2011market countries arriving at the \u201csweet spot,\u201d where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries become richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. Savings rates in emerging markets have risen from about 13\u202f% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35\u202f% today (see Exhibit\u202f1).\n\nHowever, once per\u2011capita GDP reaches the $3,000\u2011$10,000 range, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. This occurs because societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets and individuals acquire discretionary income that they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this \u201csweet spot\u201d and then fall, a pattern evident in developed markets as they became richer (Exhibit\u202f2) and now repeating itself in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, and Israel.\n\nWhat makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50\u202f% of emerging\u2011market countries (by market\u2011cap) are now in this sweet spot (Exhibit\u202f3). This was not the case ten years ago, or even five years ago. Consequently, if economic growth remains strong, we can reasonably expect large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending.\n\nA simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In 2000, when Chinese per\u2011capita GDP first crossed $1,000, auto sales just exceeded 1\u202fmillion vehicles. Ten years later, with per\u2011capita GDP more than quadrupled to $4,400, auto sales did not rise to 4\u202fmillion \u2013 they exploded to 17\u202fmillion. This non\u2011linear elasticity of demand is difficult to forecast; most analysts predict 20\u201130\u202f% growth at each point in time, followed by regular upward revisions.\n\n**The Demographic Shift**\nDemographics are also moving dramatically. The dependency ratio \u2013 the ratio of non\u2011working\u2011age to working\u2011age people \u2013 has fallen sharply in emerging markets (Exhibit\u202f4) and will remain low for the next two to three decades, meaning a larger share of the population will be in its prime working and consuming years. By contrast, the developed world faces an ageing population that will worsen its dependency ratio.\n\nThe combination of economic changes and demographic shifts points to a huge increase in the emerging\u2011market consumer base. Exhibit\u202f5 shows that roughly 500\u202fmillion new \u201cmiddle\u2011class\u201d consumers (defined as income >\u202f$6,000) could be added to emerging markets over the next five years \u2013 a number that exceeds the current population of the United States.",

      "training_answer": "**Implications for Portfolio Managers**\n\nEven though individual emerging markets are risky, their low correlations with each other and with developed markets enable risk reduction for modest allocations. Figure\u202f7 (Exhibit\u202f7) illustrates the risk\u2011return trade\u2011off of mixing the IFC Emerging Markets Index with the FT World Index over the five\u2011year period ending March\u202f1991. Adding up to about 20\u202f% emerging\u2011market exposure lowers overall portfolio volatility because of the diversification benefit; beyond that point, the higher intrinsic volatility of emerging markets begins to dominate and risk rises.\n\nDuring the sample period, emerging markets outperformed developed markets, so a 20\u202f% allocation would have reduced annual risk by 0.81\u202f% and increased annual return by 2.1\u202f%.\n\nThe authors coin the phrase \u201cdiversification free lunch\u201d to describe the current environment: investors can enjoy lower risk without sacrificing return, provided they keep the emerging\u2011market weight modest. As emerging markets develop stronger financial and trade links with the rest of the world, correlations are expected to increase, eroding this free lunch.\n\nBecause of the high within\u2011market homogeneity, active managers should focus on **country selection** rather than intensive stock picking. The larger impact of country selection is evident in the higher volatility and return dispersion across countries. Nevertheless, constructing low\u2011tracking\u2011error baskets that mimic market indices remains valuable, especially given the illiquidity of many small\u2011cap stocks. Exhibit\u202f8 shows that tracking the SET index in Thailand, the TAIEX in Taiwan, and the S&P\u202f500 requires roughly 75, 90, and 135 stocks respectively to achieve a 1\u202f% tracking error with two\u2011thirds confidence.\n\nFinally, the authors note that many emerging economies are projected to sustain higher real economic growth than developed economies, suggesting that medium\u2011 to long\u2011term equity returns should reflect this advantage. Coupled with diversification benefits, the case for adding emerging\u2011market exposure to a global portfolio is compelling.\n\n**Endnotes & References**\n\nThe paper cites sources such as the International Finance Corporation\u2019s \u201cEmerging Stock Markets Factbook\u202f1991,\u201d Brown\u202f(1991), Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek\u202f(1989), and Roll\u202f(1990). The authors conclude that while emerging markets present heightened volatility, the combination of low cross\u2011market correlations, high within\u2011market homogeneity, and superior growth prospects creates a unique risk\u2011return profile for global investors.\n\n*Key take\u2011aways*\n\n* Low correlations across emerging markets \u2192 diversification benefit.\n* High within\u2011market homogeneity \u2192 country selection matters more than stock picking.\n* Modest (\u224820\u202f%) emerging\u2011market allocation can reduce portfolio risk and boost return.\n* The \u201cfree lunch\u201d may diminish as markets become more integrated.\n* Constructing index\u2011tracking baskets is feasible with relatively few stocks due to homogeneity.",

The provided example starts with a paragraph that discusses the risks of individual emerging markets but highlights their low correlations and the benefit of diversification. The user wants the analysis to focus on the implications for portfolio managers, so I need to elaborate on how they can use these characteristics to manage risk and optimize returns.\n\nFirst, I should think about the key points from the example. The example mentions that even though individual emerging markets are risky, their low correlations with each other and with developed markets allow for risk reduction through diversification. The implication is that portfolio managers can allocate modest amounts to emerging markets to benefit from diversification without overexposing the portfolio to the risks of any single market.\n\nNow, to expand on this, I need to consider other aspects that portfolio managers might find useful. For instance, how do they choose which emerging markets to include in the portfolio? What factors should they consider besides correlation? Maybe macroeconomic indicators, political stability, currency risks, and the overall economic growth prospects of the countries.\n\nAlso, the example mentions \"modest allocation,\" so I should elaborate on the optimal allocation percentages. Maybe discuss the trade-off between risk and return, and how a small allocation can provide diversification benefits. Perhaps mention that while emerging markets can offer higher returns, the increased risk must be managed carefully.\n\nAnother point is the use of hedging strategies.",

      "training_answer": "At the end of the day (as we mentioned earlier), it\u2019s not about multinationals versus locals, but which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profits that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we find that the best (but not all) opportunities are local.\n\nPerformance data supports this view. Exhibit\u202f7 shows that emerging domestic companies have outperformed developed multinationals over the past five years, while Exhibit\u202f8 demonstrates that emerging domestic stocks still trade at a modest discount to their multinational peers. The outperformance is driven by faster earnings growth rather than valuation expansion.\n\nNot all domestic opportunities are attractive. Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel).\n\nSimilarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profitability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profitability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15\u202fmillion net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profitability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. On the other hand, the financial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well\u2011established, highly profitable banks. Only about 2\u202f% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefit from this growth without having to lower their margins.\n\nThe key is to look for fast\u2011growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows players to have high profitability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profitability in the face of non\u2011linear demand increases are most attractive. Profitability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter.\n\n**Conclusions**\nAs a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be reflected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers.\n\nThe winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home\u2011field advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well\u2011established, high\u2011quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast\u2011growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.\n\n*Disclaimer*: The views expressed are those of Arjun Divecha through the period ending 8/17/11 and are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions.
