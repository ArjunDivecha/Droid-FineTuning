EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective Contrary to popular belid investing in emevging markets can actually reduce risk. Arjun B. Divecha, Jaime Drach, and Dan Stefek ARJUN B.

DAN STEFEK is a Senior Con- sultant at BARRA. oaring returns and sanguine prospects for eco- nomic growth have fueled a recent surge of S interest in investing in “emerging” markets. Such markets have become more accessible to the global investor. Today, there are several country funds through which investors can participate in even “closed” or restricted markets. Investment wdl become easier as more countries dismantle barriers to direct foreign investment. This article presents recent research into the emerging markets from a quantitative point of view. We have developed a model for understanding the forces that drive these markets, which affords some insights for global investors. We find that while the emerging markets are more volatile than developed markets, they tend to be relatively uncorrelated with each other and with developed markets. Thus, contrary to popular belief, modest investment in the emerging markets leads to lower, rather than higher, portfolio risk for the glob- al investor (see also Brown [1991]). Over the past five years, a global investor who put 20% in an emerging markets index fund would have reduced overall annual portfolio risk from 18.3% to 17.5% while increasing annual return from 12.6% to 14.7%. One unexpected result of our research is that stock returns in the emerging markets tend to be more homogeneous than in developed markets, implying that a strong market force dominates industry and stock-specific influences. In short, when the market moves, everyone goes along for the ride. FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 41 WHICH MARKETS ARE CONSIDERED EMERGING MARKETS? EXHIBIT 1 Emerging Market Characteristics Just what is considered an emerging market is frequently a matter of opinion. Narrowly defined, an emerging market: 0 Has securities that trade in a public market. Is not a developed market (as defined by countries covered within the Morgan Stanley Capital Inter- national Indices or Financial Times Indices). Is of interest to global institutional investors. Has a reliable source of data. 0 Exhibit 1 lists the countries that we consider to be ernerging markets. They fall into three regions: Asia, Latin America, and Europe/Middle East/Africa. Singapore and Hong Kong fall into most definitions of developed markets, but are included here because they are closely related to the other Asian markets. Colom- bia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, and Zimbabwe are not of great institutional interest at present, although Pak- istan has recently opened up its economy and financial markets to foreign investors and may well be next on the list of emerging markets to attract institutional interest. Finally, Japanese over-the-counter (OTC) stocks are included in the list because they tend to behave (and are perceived) differently from listed Japanese st:ocks. R E T W I S AND RISKS OF EMERGING MARKETS The casual reader of the financial press knows there have been stories of incredible returns (high and low) in the emerging markets. The Venezuelan stock market was up about 450% in U.S. dollar terms during 1990. On the other hand, the Taiwanese Stock Exchange Index started out 1990 at about the 5,000 level, went up to 12,600 during the first quarter and collapsed 110 near 2,500 during the third quarter. What makes this even more interesting is that the Taiwanese market is only the fourth or fifth most risky emerging market! During the first half of 1991, Latin American countries dominated all others; in U.S. dollar terms, they were up over 100%. Overall, the emerging markets have done better than the 'developed markets over the past five years.

Exhibit 1 shows predicted risks according to BARRA's risk model of each of the emerging markets as well as for a few developed markets. Clearly, these 42 EMERGINZ MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 markets are extremely risky when compared with developed markets. Apart from the obvious risks (political instability, insider trading, etc.), there are a number of possible reasons why these markets are extremely volatile. First, they tend to be fairly concentrated; that is, the larger stocks have a high proportion of the over- all market capitalization. As a result, there are fewer opportunities for diversification, and returns to these large stocks dominate the overall market return. Sec- ond, unlike the developed markets, which tend to have forces that affect diverse sectors of the economy differ- ently, the emerging markets tend to have a strong mar- ket-related force that affects all stocks within a market. This tends to accentuate volatility. There are some apparent anomalies in these results. Palustan, Jordan, Colombia, Nigeria, and Zim- babwe appear to have had relatively low risk over the last five years. We believe that these low figures reflect the lack of liquidity in these markets, so observed volatilities (and correlations with other markets) must be viewed with caution. When we look at the turnover ratio (value tradedlmarket capitalization) for each market, we find that these five markets rank in the bottom six (shown in Exhibit 1). The real volatility is likely to be much higher, if and when these markets become more liquid. When we look at the emerging markets as a group (the BARRA Emerging World Universe of about 4,000 stocks), we find that it has much lower volatility than most of the individual markets. This is because of low correlations between these markets. The diversification that these low correlations offer the global investor is one of the biggest benefits of invest- ing in the emerging markets. The volatility (over the past five years) of the BARRA Emerging World Uni- verse was about 28.0%, as compared to about 18.8% for the S&P 500 or 22.8% for the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia, and the Far East (EAFE) index. A MODEL TO UNDERSTAND RISK AND RETURN To analyze risk and return in these markets, we developed a multi-factor model similar to one previous- ly constructed for the developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek [1989]). At the core of the model is a hierarchical decomposition of portfolio return into vari- ous components. This is dustrated in E h b i t 2. EXHIBIT 2 EMERGING MARKETS MODEL We focus on excess return, return beyond the risk-free rate. This return is initially broken down into currency return and excess return earned in local mar- kets. Local excess return is decomposed further into country factor return, industry return, and return accruing to salient attributes of the companies in the portfolio, e.g. the price/earnings ratio. These latter sources of return are called risk indexes. The return to a global portfolio depends on the numeraire or home country of the investor. More pre- cisely, the excess return to an investment abroad is the product of the return of the investment in its local market, 1 + r1, and the exchange return 1 + r,. With a little manipulation, this can be expressed as the sum of three components: Excess Numeraire Return = (r, + rfl - rd - (ri - rfl) + r, x q, or, (1) Currency Return - Local Excess Return + Cross-Product where rf is the risk-free rate of return in the country of the investor, and rfl is the risk-free rate in the market where the investment is being made. The first term in Equation (1) is the currency return, reflecting both the exchange return and the differential in interest rates between countries. The second term is the local excess return of the investment in its own market. The final term, r, x r1 (also known as the cross- product) poses a problem for development of a linear model. For most countries, this cross-product term is FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 43 typically small and can be disregarded for the purposes of forecasting risk. For example, ignoring the cross- product reduces the annual risk of the Korean market by 51 basis points (from 29.62% to 29.11%), and of the Taiwanese market by 103 basis points. In such cases, one can sa.fely ignore the cross-product because it is small relative to overall market risk. This is not true for Argentina or Brazil, where there are huge swings in exchange rates. Over the past five years, ignoring the cross-product would have changed the annual risk of the Argentinean market by 17% and the Brazilian market by 4%. To circumvent this difficulty, we do not try to decompose the Brazilian and Argentinean asset returns into local and currency components but rather model these assets from the U.S. perspective. In other words, we trans1at:e the prices of Brazilian and Argentinean assets into U.S. dollars and model the U.S. dollar- denomina,ted returns of these assets. Happily, this approach :is consistent with investors’ tendency to think of these assets in U.S. dollars. Next, local excess return is broken down into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk index return. The amount of an asset’s riturn arising from each component depends on its exposure to that source. The exposure of an asset to the country factor is its beta with respect to that mar- ket. Moreover, assets are exposed only to their own local markets. In contrast, industry and risk indexes are global factors in the model, i.e., it is assumed that these factors apply equally across countries. Industry exposure is defined using the Financial Times Wcdd industry classification. Each asset is assigned to exactly one of the thirty-six industry cate- gories. The risk indexes include size, success, yield, variability in markets, earnings-to-price ratio, book- to-price ra.tio, and liquidity. Exposures to these risk indexes are normalized within each country. Thus, these exposures measure how an asset compAres to the rest of its local market. A formal statement of our model for monthly local excess return is for asset n: Local Excess = Country Factor + Industry Factor + Risk Index Factor + Specific Return 44 EMERGING MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE where asset n the ith f(i) are k = 1, number of countries j = 1, number of industries i = 1, number of risk indexes P(n,k), y(n,j), and x(n,i) are the exposures of to the kth country factor, the jth industry, and risk index, respectively. Variables h(k), g(j), and returns to these factors. In estimating the factor returns, the exposures are determined from the begin- ning of month data. The part of the return that is not explained by these factors is called the specific return, u(n); it is unique to the company. The model was estimated for assets fbrn the twen- ty-three markets listed in Exhibit 1 over the period Febru- ary 1986 to July 1991. Data are drawn from numerous sources includmg the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources in thirteen countries. The results of the modeling process reveal some interesting differences between emerging and devel- oped markets. The overall proportion of variance explained by the emerging markets model (adjusted R2 ) is 50%, as compared with 38% for a :similar model that covers the developed markets (countries covered by the Financial Times Indices). At first glance it may seem surprising that a quantitative model would explain a greater proportion of return in the emerging markets than the developed markets. In order to understand this further, we looked at two submodels. The first submodel was built using only indus- try factors; i.e., we looked at what proportion of return is explained by the industry that a company is in, ignoring the country factors and :risk indexes. Thus, a definition of this model is: (3) Local Excess Return = Industry Fa.ctor + Specific Return We find the adjusted R2 for this rnodel for the emerging markets to be 16%, compared with 22% for the developed markets. This is a measure of how “global” or integrated industries are across countries. It stands to reason that the developed rnarkets have industries that are better integrated than the emerging ones, but the fact that the difference is small implies that there are cross-country industry commonalities in the emerging markets as well. The second submodel was built using only FALL 1992 country factors. Thus, we looked at what proportion of return is explained by country factors alone, ignor- ing the industry factor and risk indexes. The definition of this model is: Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return The adjusted R2 for this model for the emerg- ing markets is 46% compared with 30% for the devel- oped markets. Clearly, this country factor is the major force driving emerging markets. As one would expect, industries play a larger part in explaining return in the developed markets, while country differences play a larger role in the emerging markets. HOMOGENEITY WITHIN MARKETS The fact that country factors explain such a large proportion of variance (in absolute terms and when compared with the developed markets) in the emerging markets bears a closer look. That is, stock returns tend to be more homogeneous (within a market) in the emerging markets than in developed markets. In other words, when the market moves, there is a strong ten- dency for all stocks in the market to move with it. This difference in the proportion of return explained by the market factor (46% in emerging mar- kets versus 30% in developed countries) is not a func- tion of capitalization weighting (which leads to larger companies dominating the regression). Even when we equally weight each stock in the regression we find the same effect persists. The comparable R2 when equally weighting all stocks in the emerging markets is 42% (compared with 29% in the developed markets). At first appearance, it may seem odd that the proportion of variance explained by the market factor is so large in these markets. In order to understand this, we look at various effects that may cause this to happen. First, it may result from a concentration effect, a few large companies so dominating the market that they are, in effect, the market. Second, it may well be that these markets are actually more homogeneous (i.e., all the stocks tend to move together). Finally, there tends to be a positive correlation between the magnitude of returns within a market and the R2, i.e., to some extent, the high R2 is a natural by-product of high volatility. We first look at the concentration effect; that is, whether these markets tend to be dominated by a few large stocks. Exhibit 3 shows the proportion of market capitalization that the top ten stocks represent in each market. Most emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets. Hong Kong and Singa- pore, perhaps the two most developed of the emerging markets, are highly concentrated by this measure. On the other hand, Malaysia, Brazil, Inla, and Korea are not signlficantly more concentrated than the U.K. Of course, simply looking at the biggest ten stocks in a market is not a particularly insightful way to judge con- centration because it ignores all the other companies. Exhibit 3 shows two other more meaningful measures of concentration: asset concentration and sector concentration. Concentration is defined as (sim- ilar to Roll [1990]): Concentration = [(N/N - 1) x C(h, - l/N)2]0.5 (5) where: N = Total number ofstocks (or industries), and h, = Weight in asset (or industry) n. Asset concentration looks at how different a market is from being equally weighted. If each stock in the market had exactly the same market capitalization, this measure would be zero. If the entire market capi- talization were concentrated in one company, the mea- sure would be one. In an extremely diversified market like the U.S., the score is 0.08. Looking at this measure for the emerging markets, we can clearly see that they are more concentrated, but that the larger ones (Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.) tend to have numbers that are not much larger than the developed markets The average for these four markets is 0.13. Thus, while asset concentration plays an important role in understanding why these markets appear homoge- neous, there must be other factors at work as well. Another measure of concentration is sector concentration. If most of the stocks in a market are concentrated in one industry, it would make sense that they would tend to move together. Exhlbit 3 shows a measure of sector concentration, defined in a similar FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 45 EXHIBIT 3 Emergjng Market Statistics ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~~~ ~ Proportion of Average Capitalization Asset Sector Correlation in Top 10 Concentration Concentration Between Stocks Couni:ry Companies(%) * Factor Factor Argentina Brazil Chile Colombia Greece 65.60 26.60 50.90 75.10 50.40 0.26 0.17 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.43 0.38 0.26 0.39 0.44 0.92 0.70 0.59 0.34 0.72 Hong Kong India Indonesia Japan QTC Jordan 45.20 29.40 53.40 28.40 66.20 0.17 0.13 0.17 0.15 0.55 0.44 0.48 0.43 0.32 0.62 0.69 0.55 0.71 0.34 0.21 Korea Malaysia Mexico Nigeria Pakistan 28.90 25.10 38.40 52.50 24.40 0.16 0.12 0.21 0.17 0.14 0.28 0.28 0.42 0.66 0.33 0.56 0.57 0.70 0.23 0.17 Philippines Portugal Singapore Taiwan Thailand 65.20 44.20 54.50 41.30 32.70 0.33 0.17 0.18 0.13 0.11 0.57 0.40 0.46 0.37 0.42 0.70 0.80 0.75 0.77 0.47 Turkey Venezuela Zimbabwe 53.10 64.20 41.20 0.23 0.26 0.25 0.36 0.49 0.43 0.81 0.60 0.25 Developed Markets Japan 16.70 0.08 0.29 0.46 U.K. 25.50 0.11 0.30 0.56 U.S. 11.90 0.08 0.32 0.49 *Source: International Finance Corporation fashion as asset concentration. A score of zero implies that companies are equally distributed across all indus- tries, while a score of one implies that all the compa- nies are in one industry. The indication is that the emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets, but not much more so (although there is a popular percep- tion that inany emerging market countries are highly concentrated in certain sectors). In fact we see that Korea, Ckile, and Malaysia have less sector concentra- tion than the U.S., U.K., and Japan. The countries that are most highly concentrated in a few sectors are the smaller ones like Jordan and Nigeria. It seems clear from these results that the emerging markets are quite diversified across industries; the perception that their returns are driven by the fortunes of a single sector (like natural resources) is erroneous. What then explains the fact that stocks in these markets tend to move together? We looked at the pos- sibility that these markets are indeed more homoge- neous, after adjusting for the concentration effect. One way to do ths is to look at the average correlation of total monthly stock returns within a market, over a period of time. Exhibit 3 shows the average (i.e., unweighted) correlation between all stocks within each market (over the past five years). 46 EMEILGINI; MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 This is clearly higher for most of the emerging markets than the developed markets. With the excep- tion of the Japanese OTC market, all the other large emerging markets have high average correlations. Tai- wan has an average correlation of 0.77, Turkey 0.81, and Brazil 0.70. By comparison, the U.S. has an aver- age correlation of 0.49 and Japan 0.46. Because these correlations are unweighted, market capitalization does not play a role in determining this number. This implies that a single market force tends to have a large impact on the movement of stock prices in these markets. Even though we saw that these mar- kets are fairly well-diversified across industries, these industry differentials are overwhelmed by the domi- nant market force. Another reason for the high R2 numbers in the emerging markets is the fact that there is likely to be a positive relationship between R2 and market voladity. For example, if the market moves up 50% in a month, the likelihood is that almost all stocks in that market will also move up. Thus, one would expect to see higher R2 for the more volatile markets. We find that this is indeed true; if one excludes the most risky mar- kets (Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan), and the low liquidity ones (Pakistan, Jordan, Colombia, Nige- ria, and Zimbabwe) the average R2 for the emerging markets is s i d a r to that for the developed markets. Overall, from a global investor’s viewpoint, this homogeneity phenomenon implies that being in the right market at the right time is more important than the ability to pick good stocks within that market. Clearly, if you are going to be in Brazil in a month when the market moves up 50%, the high within-mar- ket correlations (0.70 for Brazil) are likely to ensure that any diversified portfolio will experience high pos- itive returns. From a global investor’s point of view, the impact of this conclusion is accentuated by the low across-market correlations. HETEROGENEITY ACROSS MARKETS This phenomenon of homogeneity does not apply across markets. In fact, we see that the emerging markets are much less correlated with each other than are the developed markets. Exhibit 4 shows the corre- lations of emerging markets with each other. While we see that some markets tend to move together (Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore), most markets tend to have very low correlations with each other. In fact, the average correlation between the emerging EXHIBIT 4 Correlations Between Emerging Markets (February 1986 - March 1991) Source: BARRA.

We propose two explanations as to why they have been uncorrelated with each other. First, many of the emerging markets have (or had) few economic and trade lir ks with each other. Consequently, their economies tend to be unrelated to each other. Second, many have (or had) severe restrictions on outsiders participating in their markets. Therefore, they are somewhat insulated from worldwide (or even regional) patterns in stock market returns. For example, in October 1987, while the world's markets were crashing, the Indian stock market was up mod- estly. Nlow the current trend is for most of the emerging economies to develop greater trade links with the developed world and each other. Most of the countries that are closed to foreign participation in their stock markets are also in the process of liberaliz- ing rules for foreigners to participate in their markets. With these increasing links between markets, we should expect to see correlations between the emerg- ing markets increase in the future. When we contrast these low correlations with the correlations between developed markets (Exhibit 5), we see that they have much higher correlations with each other. A quick glance at Exhibits 4 and 5 confirms that the developed markets are much more correlated with each other than the emerging markets are. The average correlation between the developed markets was 0.49 (over the same five-year period). While all the correlations between the developed mar- kets were positive, 89 of the 276 correlations between the emerging markets were negative (over this five- year period). From a global investor's point of view, a more interesting question is not so much how the emerg- ing markets relate to each other, but how they relate to the developed markets, individually and as a group. Overall, the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the Finan- cial Times World Index was 0.35 over the past five years. Exhibit 6 shows the cross-correlations between emerging markets and developed markets.

Write an investment analysis on the topic discussed in this excerpt: Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective Contrary to popular belid investing in emevging markets is not necessarily a bet on economic growth. The link between stock returns and economic growth in emerging markets is much weaker than in developed markets. In emerging markets, stock returns are more closely related to changes in asset prices in advanced economies and to capital flows than to domestic economic fundamentals. The correlation between emerging market stock returns and U.S. equity returns has increased over time, especially since the 2008 global financial crisis. The correlation between emerging market stock returns and U.S. interest rates has also increased over time. The correlation between emerging market stock returns and the U.S. dollar has increased over time as well. The U.S. dollar is negatively correlated with emerging market stock returns.

QUESTION 2:
What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong ... (Please provide a detailed analysis)

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong again. The prevailing view is that the rapid rise of gold prices over the past ten years has been caused by monetary authorities in the developed world debasing their currencies. By this logic, investors in the developed world have hedged debasement risk by pouring money into gold, both in the form of direct purchases and via ETFs. We believe that gold is an emerging markets asset as much as it is a bet against the Federal Reserve and much of the rise in gold prices has been driven by purchases by emerging consumers, who are driven primarily by “financial repression”. The traditional framework used to analyze gold starts with the assumption that gold is the ultimate store of value. Along these lines, if faith in paper currencies wanes, the price of gold should then rise. Consequently, gold prices should be highly correlated to inflation. The traditional barometer for inflation and weak central banks and thus gold, is US inflation. This line of reasoning does provide some insight. Changes in US inflation do explain gold price movements until 2000. Through the 70s, 80s and 90s, changes in gold the gold price were matched by changes in the inflation rate. Nonetheless, we believe “conventional wisdom” is naive. It fails to explain the last 10 years. Befuddling conventional wisdom, gold prices climbed from $300/oz. in 1999 to the current $1,700, while actual inflation and expected inflation remained very well behaved, staying between 0% and 5% through this duration. The missing factor is emerging markets. Gold purchases over the past 10 years have increasingly been derived from emerging markets, especially emerging Asian countries (with India, China and Vietnam representing the largest change). Whereas in 1999, emerging markets accounted for only xx% of global gold demand, by 2010 this figure had reached 79% and has increased since then. Chart 1 shows that emerging Asia’s share of global gold demand has increased from 39% of global demand in 1999 to 57% by 2010 and is concomitant with the rapid rise in gold prices. In fact, as Chart 2 shows, in dollar terms, emerging Asian purchases of gold have risen from about $10 billion in 1999 to $70 billion in 2010. Chart 3 shows aggregate demand of gold from 2000 to 2010. A total of 29,342 tons of gold were purchased for both investment and jewelry. Key observations: Developed market purchases of gold bars and jewelry accounted for 7,200 tons or 25%. Despite all the attention in the media, ETFs only accounted for 2,200 tons, less than 7.5% of the total. Central banks were net sellers of 3,300 tons, even as the Chinese and Russian central banks purchased 1,050 tons. Retail from emerging markets totaled over 23,200 tons, a staggering 79% of total demand, far and away the primary demand component over this period China and India alone combined for a total of 9,000 tons, a figure that’s more than the developed world as a whole and four times aggregate ETF demand. The data shows that the bets against the Federal Reserve over the past decade were a pretty small part of the total demand. Instead, the really big bets were of a different flavor and originating almost entirely from emerging markets. We believe the interplay between tremendous growth in household savings in emerging markets coupled with “financial repression” has been fuelling this emerging markets gold factor. Because of capital controls which severely restrict money outflows, Chinese and Indian residents are essentially forced to either deposit their savings in a bank or invest in local equities. Governments regulate deposit rates, forcing negative real rates. Moreover, local equity markets are often incomplete. Recent dismal performance of these equity markets has not been encouraging either. Gold jewelry and gold bars, along with real estate are the most prominent of few alternatives. Coupled with this “financial repression”, savings in emerging markets rose dramatically in both relative and absolute terms between 2000 and 2010. In 2000, EM accounted for xx% of global GDP and by 2010 this figure was xx%. Domestic savings in China rose from a 41% average in the 90s to 47% in the 2000s, India’s savings rate rose from 23% to 29%. Consequently, combined gross savings in India and China increased from $557bn in 2000 to $3.4trn in 2010. Essentially, there was an enormous increase of money available to invest, and given the lack of good alternatives, gold was a preferred destination. The point is that the main driver for gold’s dramatic rise has been the emerging markets consumer. This is not to say that the “conventional wisdom” drivers for gold are not relevant. We believe they are. However, we believe they have not been material for the past 10 years The implications for gold’s outlook are both negative and positive. On one hand, gold prices may be at risk if emerging market economies slow down, or worse, experience a hard landing. It’s estimated that Indian households currently own 18,000 tons of gold, the equivalent of seven or eight years of global demand. If India were to experience a significant slowdown, some of this gold may go to market, although Indians have historically held onto their gold in bad times. Even in the scenario that EM economies maintain their momentum, gold would be negatively impacted if “financial repression” eases and India and China loosen capital controls and allow assets to flow outside the country. On the other hand, this analysis indicates that “conventional wisdom” demand is far from saturated. Central banks have been net sellers of gold. Gold remains a small percent of overall reserves. Similarly, gold as a percentage of the liquid portfolio in the developed market remains untapped. These latter two reasons indicate that gold prices may very well experience another leg up. Our point is not make predictions about the price of gold, but to create awareness that emerging markets represent a significant factor in how gold is being, as will be priced in the future.

Gold has long been considered a safe haven asset, traditionally driven by factors such as inflation, geopolitical tensions, and central bank purchases. However, the article "Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew?" challenges this conventional wisdom by suggesting that the growing consumer demand in emerging markets is a significant, yet underappreciated, driver of gold prices. This perspective shifts the focus from institutional and macroeconomic factors to the retail and consumer behavior in developing economies. In this analysis, we will explore the validity of this claim, the implications for investors, and the broader context of gold's role in global markets.
### The Conventional Wisdom on Gold Prices
Traditionally, gold prices have been analyzed through the lens of macroeconomic indicators and institutional behavior. Key factors include:
1. **Inflation and Currency Devaluation**: Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation, especially in times of economic uncertainty.
2. **Geopolitical Tensions**: During periods of political instability or conflict, investors tend to flock to gold as a safe haven.
3. **Central Bank Purchases**: Central banks, particularly in emerging markets, have been significant buyers of gold to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and stabilize their currencies.

Emerging Thoughts April 2018: Russia
“Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is,
Do you, Mr. Jones?”
Bob Dylan, Ballad of a Thin Man
That’s what it kind of feels like today, that there’s something going on behind the scenes beyond the obvious, but we are not privy to it.
The Russian market fell 10% on the back of new US sanctions and a chemical weapon attack in Syria. This is a much larger reaction than one would have expected. It’s not clear that the two situations (sanctions and Syria) are linked, but the market perceives that the risk of a major blowup with Russia (maybe Iran or North Korea style sanctions) has increased dramatically. We don’t buy it.
Our sources in Washington tell us that the new sanctions (and their timing) were a complete surprise to everyone in congress – that this was purely a White House operation. The fact that Mr. Oleg Deripaska (who is closely associated with Mr. Paul Manafort) and companies he controls was the main target would suggest that there’s a political dimension to this. If the intent was to hurt Russia economically, sanctioning companies such as Gazprom, Sberbank and Lukoil would have had a much more profound impact. Our sources in Moscow also suggest a similar view.
The new risk is that the White House is now actively involved with day to day Russia policy and everyone is uncertain as to what Mr. Trump might tweet tomorrow.
In short we don’t think the US is exercising the “nuclear option” of trying to tank the Russian economy and this action does not signal movement in that direction. While this action will cause pain in certain areas, we do not think it has a profound impact on the Russian economy. As a result, we are quite comfortable with our overweight in Russian equites, who continue to be extremely cheap.
Within the Russian market, Gazprom fell 8% while Sberbank fell almost 22%. Gazprom is very unlikely to be sanctioned because it supplies 30% of Europe’s natural gas and so makes sense that it would be less affected. 
On the other hand, we believe Sberbank’s dramatic fall reflects the fact that it is the most foreigner owned and most liquid Russian stock (the GDR trades an average of $100 million daily in London alone) and was hard hit for liquidity rather than fundamental reasons. Sberbank has only 3% of its assets exposed to companies that were sanctioned. It is Russia’s largest bank, with 20,000 branches and 65% of all deposits in the country. It trades at 5 times current earnings, 1.3 times book value while earning 23% return on equity. It is one of the largest positions in our portfolio and we are adding to it.

Emerging Markets, April 2018
Emerging Markets have been on a bumpy ride in 2018, with the US dollar rising and the US Federal Reserve hiking rates. The US dollar has been on a tear, with the DXY index up 6.5% year to date, and the US Fed has raised rates three times in 2018. The US dollar has been a beneficiary of the US economic expansion and the Fed’s tightening cycle. The US economy is growing at a healthy pace, with GDP growth of 2.3% in Q1 2018, and the Fed is expected to continue raising rates in 2018 and 2019. The US dollar is expected to continue to strengthen, which is bad news for Emerging Markets, as they are dollar denominated debtors and are vulnerable to a strong dollar.
Emerging Markets have been hit by the strong dollar, with the MSCI Emerging Markets index down 10% year to date. The index is down 10% because of the strong dollar and the US Fed’s tightening cycle. The index is also down because of the trade war between the US and China, which has created uncertainty and has led to a flight to quality. The trade war has also led to a slowdown in global trade, which is bad news for Emerging Markets, as they are reliant on global trade

It’s not clear that the two are linked, but the market perceives that the US is escalating tensions with Russia and this could lead to a new cold war. We don’t believe that this is in the US national interest and it would be irrational for the US to engage Russia in a new cold war on multiple fronts (Europe, Korea, Middle East). The new US administration has lots of problems on its plate and engaging Russia in a meaningful way is a long-term project. It’s more likely that the US will try to contain Russia and put it in check rather than engage it in a new cold war.
If the US is not behind the recent events in Syria, then who is and why? And more importantly, who benefits from a new cold war? It’s inconceivable that the Assad regime would use chemical weapons after all these years

EXPECTED ANSWER:
GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, Stays in Emerging Arjun Divecha The Opportunity We have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets. In the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4 trillion and daily trading volume of around $40 billion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets. While there are many ways to segment emerging markets – by region, big cap vs. small cap, value vs. growth – we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure. In recent years, there has been much talk about the coupling/decoupling of emerging markets vis-à-vis the developed world. We fi nd this either/or characterization misses the mark when, in fact, the reality is far more complicated. Perhaps a better way to think about growth in emerging markets is to characterize it as having two components: correlated growth, which is driven by links with the developed world, and uncorrelated growth, which depends more on the internal dynamics and demographics of the emerging markets themselves. From this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalized world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a “seven lean years” scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a “pure play” on the economic growth of these countries. The Case for Domestic Demand Looking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors. In addition, because they compete globally, margins are likely to be squeezed by having to go toe-to-toe with well-capitalized global competitors. 2 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Global commodity producers may continue to do well (as they have over the previous decade) if commodity prices stay high or rise even further. For most institutional investors, it makes sense to have an overall commodity strategy with commodity producers from emerging markets in the mix. However, we do not believe that they represent an emerging “pure play” as they are driven by global rather than purely emerging market forces. The main case for the domestic demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confl uence of two forces: economics and demographics. The Economic Case The economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging market countries arriving at the “sweet spot,” where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries begin to get richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. For example, we have seen savings rates in emerging markets rise from 13% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35% today (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1 Savings Rates Have Risen with Income in Emerging Markets However, once per capita GDP levels reach the range of $3,000 to $10,000, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. We believe that this occurs for two reasons. First, at these levels of national wealth, societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets. Second, individuals have newfound discretionary income, which they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this “sweet spot” of $3,000 to $10,000 per capita GDP and then drop. Exhibit 2 shows this pattern in a number of developed markets as they became richer. In recent years, we have seen the same pattern repeated in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, Israel, etc. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Savings Rate Mean Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 3 Exhibit 2 However, Savings Rates Drop Dramatically When GDP/Capita Reaches the $3,000-$10,000 Range We've Seen This in Developed Markets at a Similar Stage of Development Korea Savings Rate vs. Per Capita GDP 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Portugal 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Japan -20 0 20 40 60 80 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Greece 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Australia 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 $0 $5,000 $10,000 $15,000 $20,000 $25,000 Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO 4 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 What makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50% of emerging market countries (by market cap) are in this sweet spot (Exhibit 3). This was not the case 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago. Thus, if economic growth remains strong in emerging markets, one can reasonably expect to see large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending. Exhibit 3 50% of Emerging Countries Are Now in the Sweet Spot of Shifting from Savings to Consumption While a number of sell-side analysts suggest that this story is already well-known and priced into markets, we beg to differ. We believe when incomes reach this sweet spot, the elasticity of demand becomes highly non-linear, where small increases in per capita income lead to large increases in consumption. A simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In the year 2000, Chinese crossed $1,000 per capita GDP. In that year, auto sales fi rst exceeded 1 million vehicles. Ten years later, Chinese GDP more than quadrupled, to $4,400 per capita. What happened to auto sales? Did they go from 1 million to 4 million? No. They went from 1 million to 17 million! No analyst that we know of predicted anything close to these numbers. It’s very diffi cult to forecast this kind of growth, so high growth forecasts tend to be 20% to 30% at each point in time, followed by upward revisions on a regular basis. As a result of these factors, we are reasonably confi dent that per capita consumption in emerging market countries will rise substantially in the next few years and that much of this consumption growth is not anticipated by markets. The Demographic Shift What makes an already good story potentially explosive is the fact that demographics are not static and indicate that the number of people in their prime working (and consuming) years will also rise dramatically in the next few years (both in absolute terms and relative to the developed markets). Exhibit 4 shows the dependency ratio, which is defi ned as the ratio of non-working-age to working-age people in both the emerging and developed markets. As the downward sloping line shows, demographics in emerging markets have improved dramatically over the last few years (with the dependency ratio falling) and they will remain in this sweet spot for the next few decades. What this means is that the number of people that are working relative to those not working has dramatically improved and will remain there for the next 20 to 30 years. (Obviously, this is not true for all emerging market countries. Eastern Europe’s and China’s dependency ratios deteriorate quite rapidly over the next 25 years, while those of India, Indonesia, and Turkey improve.)

GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 5 Exhibit 4 Growth: Demographics Play An Important Role Improvement in Demographics Has Played a Signifi cant Role in Increased Growth Rates Conversely, as baby boomers retire in the developed world, the dependency ratio will worsen and there will be fewer workers (as a proportion of the population) and the overall number of hours worked will decrease. The overall global effect will be to shift consumption (as a result of increasing income) from the developed world to the emerging world. Economic Changes + Demographic Shift = Huge Increase in Consumer Base With these global shifts in economics and demographics upon us, the focus of economic activity is likely to shift toward domestic demand providers within emerging markets. Exhibit 5 shows the number of people that one might term “middle class” (defi ned as having an income greater than $6,000) that will be added to the emerging markets over the next fi ve years (assuming the continuation of current growth rates). This number is far greater than the current population of the United States. We are very confi dent that, absent some global catastrophe, domestic demand in emerging market countries will be robust over the next few years, irrespective of what may or may not happen in the developed world. So, what could derail this story? The most likely candidate is oil rising to $200/barrel and staying there for an extended period. In general, very high commodity prices would have a major impact on consumption in emerging markets, and would shift potential return from domestic demand companies to commodity producers. * Percent of non-working to working people. Source: United Nations 6 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Exhibit 5 If Current Trends Persist, the Emerging Middle Class Will Increase by around 500 Million People in the Next 5 Years How Does One Take Advantage of This? Recently, we’ve been asked by a number of our clients if this anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue – the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities. At this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets and thus most multinationals do not represent a “pure play” on emerging domestic demand. For example, if we screen the MS World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50% of their sales from emerging markets, we fi nd 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574 billion and make up only 2.1% of the market value of the MSCI World Index. Exhibit 6 shows the 10 largest companies in this group – not exactly the household names one expects to see. -370 463 80 -500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Less than $6,000 (Below Middle Class) $6,000 to $30,000 (Middle Class) More Than $30,000 Millions Emerging Markets – Change in Consumer Base 2010-2015 70% of Europe Population Source: Goldman Sachs, World Bank GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 7 Exhibit 6 In addition, our view is that locally-domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home-fi eld advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from numerous sources, including high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well-established local brands, government policies that tend to favor locals, and the fact that local competitors are likely to have high profi tability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend – rather than build – their market share. A good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to be able to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia, it would be extremely expensive. In addition, they would have great diffi culty competing against a well-established player such as Magnit, which runs 4,000 plus stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20% (both of which allow it to make life very diffi cult for new entrants). We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build out its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where they paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefi ts of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future. This is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long-standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in countries like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profi tability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally-listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade-off between “pure-play” and valuation. For example, Domino’s Pizza has a market cap of $1.6 billion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3 billion, despite contributing less than 10% of the sales and 18% of the profi ts of the overall company. If our thesis of home fi eld advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past 5 years. Exhibit 7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive from a valuation point of view relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit 8 shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason domestic emerging companies outperformed was because their earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion. Name Country Market Value ($M) % Sales to EM QUALCOMM Inc.

As of 7/31/11 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 9 At the end of the day (as we mentioned earlier), it’s not about multinationals versus locals, but which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profi ts that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we fi nd that the best (but not all) opportunities are local. Not All Domestic Opportunities Are Attractive Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Similarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profi tability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profi tability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15 million net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profi tability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. Thus, high growth in this sector is unlikely to translate into high returns for shareholders. On the other hand, the fi nancial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well-established, highly profi table banks. Only 2% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefi t from this growth without having to lower their margins. The key is to look for fast-growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows for players to have high profi tability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profi tability in the face of non-linear demand increases are most attractive. Profi tability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter. In GMO parlance – focus on quality within fast-growing country/sectors. Conclusions As a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe that we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in the emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be refl ected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers. The winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home-fi eld advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well-established, high quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast-growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.

(Please provide a detailed analysis) GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, Stays in Emerging… Mostly The rapid growth of the middle class in emerging markets has created a significant increase in discretionary income. This has led to a surge in demand for entertainment and leisure activities. However, the lack of developed infrastructure and institutions in these markets means that this demand is not being fully satisfied. As a result, we are seeing a large and growing market opportunity for companies that can provide entertainment and leisure experiences tailored to the unique needs and preferences of emerging market consumers. In this paper, we will focus on the opportunities in the gaming and media sectors. We believe that gaming and media are particularly well-suited to emerging markets because they are relatively low-cost and can be easily adapted to local tastes and preferences. Additionally, the rise of mobile technology is making it easier than ever to deliver these experiences to consumers in emerging markets. We will first take a look at the gaming industry in emerging markets. The gaming industry is still in its early stages of development in most emerging markets. This means that there is a large untapped market opportunity for companies that can provide gaming experiences that resonate with local consumers. We believe that there are a number of key factors that will drive the growth of the gaming industry in emerging markets. First and foremost is the growth of the middle class and the associated increase in discretionary income. As more people in emerging markets gain access

Emerging Thoughts: 
Domesticate – Don’t Downsize!
Buying small cap stocks in emerging markets is the best way to access burgeoning domestic demand: Not!!!
Given economic and demographic changes in the world, we (amongst others) believe that one of the most compelling  investment destinations over the next few years is likely to be in companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets (see the recent GMO White Paper entitled “What Happens In Emerging, Stays in Emerging”). 
However, we increasingly hear that the best way to capture this domestic demand story is through small cap stocks in emerging markets. We believe this is a mistake. In this paper, we argue that small caps are NOT a good proxy for domestic demand. Besides, why buy a proxy when you can buy the real thing?
First let’s look at why people are making this argument – it rests on the presumption that large caps in emerging markets are mainly focused on export and globally oriented businesses. As a result, removing these large cap names from the investable universe will leave a universe of companies that are largely focused on domestic demand. The first part of this contention is true, the second is not. Large caps are highly geared to global demand. However, the small cap universe does not represent a pure play on domestic demand.
Figure 1 shows the sector weights of Small Cap and Broad Emerging universes*, separated into sectors that are domestically oriented (Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Health Care, Telecoms and Utilities) and those that are globally sensitive (Energy, Materials, Technology and most Industrials). As the chart clearly shows, globally sensitive sectors are almost as highly represented in aggregate in the small cap universe as in the broad universe. In fact globally sensitive sectors represent 45% of the small cap universe vs. 47% for the broad universe. 
Instead of using the lazy man’s approach to domestic demand by using small caps as a proxy, what if we were to build a universe of companies that primarily serve domestic demand, based on who their ultimate customer is. This universe would eliminate all companies that primarily serve global demand, determined on a company by company basis by looking at their financial statements, a few telephone calls and some shoe leather. 
Figure 2 shows sector weights of this true domestic demand universe alongside that of the small cap universe. We see that the domestic universe has a far lower exposure to globally sensitive sectors than the small cap universe. In fact, even the companies represented within globally sensitive sectors of the domestic universe are those that specifically serve domestic demand such as technology companies whose business is primarily within emerging markets rather than those that export to developed countries. An example of this would be Kingdee International, which provides Chinese language ERP software and services and competes with the likes of SAP for small and medium size businesses in China. 
.
Last, but not least, not all domestic demand in emerging is served by companies domiciled within emerging markets. Global multinationals also serve this demand and in some cases, are dominant players. A true domestic demand universe should include these multinationals, especially ones that get a substantial part of their earnings/revenues from serving this demand in emerging markets. These multinationals will never be part of the EM small cap universe, and while they represent a small part of the domestic demand universe at the current time, we should expect them to become a larger part of the domestic demand opportunity (as their earnings and revenues from emerging markets continue to grow). Examples range from relatively new entrants like Yum Brands (which owns and operates the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut franchises) to Unilever (which set up a local subsidiary in India in 1931 and was listed on the Indian stock market in 1956). 
To conclude, the best way to access demand from burgeoning middle classes in emerging markets is to invest in companies that directly serve that demand, rather than using EM small caps as a proxy. 
 In short, Domesticate – Don’t Downsize!!!
* The broad universe includes all companies represented in union of the S&P/IFC EM Investable Universe and the MSCI EM Universe weighted by investable capitalization – about 3,500 companies. The Small Cap universe represents the bottom 25% of the broad universe by market capitalization, about 2,700 companies.

wait for it... emerging consensus. But is it right? The answer is no. The emerging markets are not emerging. They are domesticating. The consensus is wrong.

Okay, so the user wants an investment analysis based on this excerpt. Let me start by understanding the main points here. The author is arguing against the common belief that investing in small-cap stocks in emerging markets is a good strategy. Instead, they say that emerging markets are "domesticating," meaning they're becoming more like developed markets, which might lead to slower growth. The key idea is that the consensus is wrong, and emerging markets won't outperform developed ones.

First, I need to break down the arguments. The author claims that emerging markets are not "emerging" anymore but are domesticating. So, maybe they're becoming more regulated, more integrated into the global economy, or facing structural issues that slow growth. The user wants an analysis, so I

screwed. The Chinese government has been playing a long game with their economy and their stock market. They’ve been building up a façade of strength and growth, but the reality is that they’re in a precarious position. The debt levels are through the roof, and the real estate market is a ticking time bomb. The government has been propping things up with stimulus and debt, but that’s not sustainable. The problem is that the government is now in a position where they can’t let the market crash, but they also can’t keep propping it up forever. So what happens when the government decides to screw you? You’re screwed. That’s the China syndrome. The question is, what can investors do about it? Well, the answer is simple: don’t invest in China. Period. The risks are too high, and the potential rewards are too low.

QUESTION 7:
Write an investment analysis on the topic discussed in this excerpt: Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong ...

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong again. The prevailing view is that the rapid rise of gold prices over the past ten years has been caused by monetary authorities in the developed world debasing their currencies. By this logic, investors in the developed world have hedged debasement risk by pouring money into gold, both in the form of direct purchases and via ETFs. We believe that gold is an emerging markets asset as much as it is a bet against the Federal Reserve and much of the rise in gold prices has been driven by purchases by emerging consumers, who are driven primarily by “financial repression”. The traditional framework used to analyze gold starts with the assumption that gold is the ultimate store of value. Along these lines, if faith in paper currencies wanes, the price of gold should then rise. Consequently, gold prices should be highly correlated to inflation. The traditional barometer for inflation and weak central banks and thus gold, is US inflation. This line of reasoning does provide some insight. Changes in US inflation do explain gold price movements until 2000. Through the 70s, 80s and 90s, changes in gold the gold price were matched by changes in the inflation rate. Nonetheless, we believe “conventional wisdom” is naive. It fails to explain the last 10 years. Befuddling conventional wisdom, gold prices climbed from $300/oz. in 1999 to the current $1,700, while actual inflation and expected inflation remained very well behaved, staying between 0% and 5% through this duration. The missing factor is emerging markets. Gold purchases over the past 10 years have increasingly been derived from emerging markets, especially emerging Asian countries (with India, China and Vietnam representing the largest change). Whereas in 1999, emerging markets accounted for only xx% of global gold demand, by 2010 this figure had reached 79% and has increased since then. Chart 1 shows that emerging Asia’s share of global gold demand has increased from 39% of global demand in 1999 to 57% by 2010 and is concomitant with the rapid rise in gold prices. In fact, as Chart 2 shows, in dollar terms, emerging Asian purchases of gold have risen from about $10 billion in 1999 to $70 billion in 2010. Chart 3 shows aggregate demand of gold from 2000 to 2010. A total of 29,342 tons of gold were purchased for both investment and jewelry. Key observations: Developed market purchases of gold bars and jewelry accounted for 7,200 tons or 25%. Despite all the attention in the media, ETFs only accounted for 2,200 tons, less than 7.5% of the total. Central banks were net sellers of 3,300 tons, even as the Chinese and Russian central banks purchased 1,050 tons. Retail from emerging markets totaled over 23,200 tons, a staggering 79% of total demand, far and away the primary demand component over this period China and India alone combined for a total of 9,000 tons, a figure that’s more than the developed world as a whole and four times aggregate ETF demand. The data shows that the bets against the Federal Reserve over the past decade were a pretty small part of the total demand. Instead, the really big bets were of a different flavor and originating almost entirely from emerging markets. We believe the interplay between tremendous growth in household savings in emerging markets coupled with “financial repression” has been fuelling this emerging markets gold factor. Because of capital controls which severely restrict money outflows, Chinese and Indian residents are essentially forced to either deposit their savings in a bank or invest in local equities. Governments regulate deposit rates, forcing negative real rates. Moreover, local equity markets are often incomplete. Recent dismal performance of these equity markets has not been encouraging either. Gold jewelry and gold bars, along with real estate are the most prominent of few alternatives. Coupled with this “financial repression”, savings in emerging markets rose dramatically in both relative and absolute terms between 2000 and 2010. In 2000, EM accounted for xx% of global GDP and by 2010 this figure was xx%. Domestic savings in China rose from a 41% average in the 90s to 47% in the 2000s, India’s savings rate rose from 23% to 29%. Consequently, combined gross savings in India and China increased from $557bn in 2000 to $3.4trn in 2010. Essentially, there was an enormous increase of money available to invest, and given the lack of good alternatives, gold was a preferred destination. The point is that the main driver for gold’s dramatic rise has been the emerging markets consumer. This is not to say that the “conventional wisdom” drivers for gold are not relevant. We believe they are. However, we believe they have not been material for the past 10 years The implications for gold’s outlook are both negative and positive. On one hand, gold prices may be at risk if emerging market economies slow down, or worse, experience a hard landing. It’s estimated that Indian households currently own 18,000 tons of gold, the equivalent of seven or eight years of global demand. If India were to experience a significant slowdown, some of this gold may go to market, although Indians have historically held onto their gold in bad times. Even in the scenario that EM economies maintain their momentum, gold would be negatively impacted if “financial repression” eases and India and China loosen capital controls and allow assets to flow outside the country. On the other hand, this analysis indicates that “conventional wisdom” demand is far from saturated. Central banks have been net sellers of gold. Gold remains a small percent of overall reserves. Similarly, gold as a percentage of the liquid portfolio in the developed market remains untapped. These latter two reasons indicate that gold prices may very well experience another leg up. Our point is not make predictions about the price of gold, but to create awareness that emerging markets represent a significant factor in how gold is being, as will be priced in the future. Amit Bhartia Matt Seto

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
the real driver of gold prices is not the U.S. dollar but the emerging consumer. The chart below shows the correlation between the price of gold and the size of the middle class in China and India. The chart shows that as the middle class in China and India grows, the demand for gold increases, which in turn drives up the price of gold. This is because as people become more affluent, they tend to buy more gold for jewelry and as a store of value. The chart also shows that the correlation between the price of gold and the U.S. dollar is not as strong as previously thought. This is because when the U.S. dollar weakens, other currencies strengthen, which can make gold more expensive for investors in those countries, thus reducing demand. The article argues that investors should focus on the growth of the middle class in emerging markets when making investment decisions related to gold, rather than solely on the performance of the U.S. dollar.

Okay, so I need to write an investment analysis based on this excerpt. Let me start by understanding the main points. The article says that the traditional belief is that the U.S. dollar's value affects gold prices, but the real driver is the growing middle class in China and India. The middle class buying more gold for jewelry and as a store of value is driving up prices. Also, the correlation with the U.S. dollar isn't as strong as thought before because when the dollar weakens, other currencies get stronger, making gold more

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The new EM pillars are the next generation of emerging market economies that are poised for significant growth and investment opportunities. These economies are characterized by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, increasing market liquidity, and a growing addressable market. The new EM pillars include countries such as India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, among others. These countries are experiencing rapid urbanization, a growing middle class, and increasing digital adoption, which are driving economic growth and creating new investment opportunities. The new EM pillars are also benefiting from favorable demographic trends, with a young and growing population that is driving demand for goods and services. Additionally, these countries are implementing structural reforms and improving their business environments, which is attracting foreign investment and boosting economic growth. The new EM pillars are also less vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks compared to traditional emerging markets, as they have more diversified economies and are less reliant on commodity exports. Finally, these countries are also making progress in ESG and domestic policy reforms, which is making them more attractive to investors seeking sustainable and responsible investment opportunities.

What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, St...

EXPECTED ANSWER:
GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, Stays in Emerging Arjun Divecha The Opportunity We have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets. In the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4 trillion and daily trading volume of around $40 billion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets. While there are many ways to segment emerging markets – by region, big cap vs. small cap, value vs. growth – we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure. In recent years, there has been much talk about the coupling/decoupling of emerging markets vis-à-vis the developed world. We fi nd this either/or characterization misses the mark when, in fact, the reality is far more complicated. Perhaps a better way to think about growth in emerging markets is to characterize it as having two components: correlated growth, which is driven by links with the developed world, and uncorrelated growth, which depends more on the internal dynamics and demographics of the emerging markets themselves. From this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalized world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a “seven lean years” scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a “pure play” on the economic growth of these countries. The Case for Domestic Demand Looking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors. In addition, because they compete globally, margins are likely to be squeezed by having to go toe-to-toe with well-capitalized global competitors. 2 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Global commodity producers may continue to do well (as they have over the previous decade) if commodity prices stay high or rise even further. For most institutional investors, it makes sense to have an overall commodity strategy with commodity producers from emerging markets in the mix. However, we do not believe that they represent an emerging “pure play” as they are driven by global rather than purely emerging market forces. The main case for the domestic demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confl uence of two forces: economics and demographics. The Economic Case The economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging market countries arriving at the “sweet spot,” where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries begin to get richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. For example, we have seen savings rates in emerging markets rise from 13% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35% today (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1 Savings Rates Have Risen with Income in Emerging Markets However, once per capita GDP levels reach the range of $3,000 to $10,000, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. We believe that this occurs for two reasons. First, at these levels of national wealth, societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets. Second, individuals have newfound discretionary income, which they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this “sweet spot” of $3,000 to $10,000 per capita GDP and then drop. Exhibit 2 shows this pattern in a number of developed markets as they became richer. In recent years, we have seen the same pattern repeated in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, Israel, etc. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Savings Rate Mean Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 3 Exhibit 2 However, Savings Rates Drop Dramatically When GDP/Capita Reaches the $3,000-$10,000 Range We've Seen This in Developed Markets at a Similar Stage of Development Korea Savings Rate vs. Per Capita GDP 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Portugal 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Japan -20 0 20 40 60 80 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Greece 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Australia 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 $0 $5,000 $10,000 $15,000 $20,000 $25,000 Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO 4 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 What makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50% of emerging market countries (by market cap) are in this sweet spot (Exhibit 3). This was not the case 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago. Thus, if economic growth remains strong in emerging markets, one can reasonably expect to see large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending. Exhibit 3 50% of Emerging Countries Are Now in the Sweet Spot of Shifting from Savings to Consumption While a number of sell-side analysts suggest that this story is already well-known and priced into markets, we beg to differ. We believe when incomes reach this sweet spot, the elasticity of demand becomes highly non-linear, where small increases in per capita income lead to large increases in consumption. A simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In the year 2000, Chinese crossed $1,000 per capita GDP. In that year, auto sales fi rst exceeded 1 million vehicles. Ten years later, Chinese GDP more than quadrupled, to $4,400 per capita. What happened to auto sales? Did they go from 1 million to 4 million? No. They went from 1 million to 17 million! No analyst that we know of predicted anything close to these numbers. It’s very diffi cult to forecast this kind of growth, so high growth forecasts tend to be 20% to 30% at each point in time, followed by upward revisions on a regular basis. As a result of these factors, we are reasonably confi dent that per capita consumption in emerging market countries will rise substantially in the next few years and that much of this consumption growth is not anticipated by markets. The Demographic Shift What makes an already good story potentially explosive is the fact that demographics are not static and indicate that the number of people in their prime working (and consuming) years will also rise dramatically in the next few years (both in absolute terms and relative to the developed markets). Exhibit 4 shows the dependency ratio, which is defi ned as the ratio of non-working-age to working-age people in both the emerging and developed markets. As the downward sloping line shows, demographics in emerging markets have improved dramatically over the last few years (with the dependency ratio falling) and they will remain in this sweet spot for the next few decades. What this means is that the number of people that are working relative to those not working has dramatically improved and will remain there for the next 20 to 30 years. (Obviously, this is not true for all emerging market countries. Eastern Europe’s and China’s dependency ratios deteriorate quite rapidly over the next 25 years, while those of India, Indonesia, and Turkey improve.) Weight in S&P/IFCI Composite Index 2005 2010 Less than $3,000 per capita GDP 19% 13% Between $3,000 and $10,000 per capita GDP 41% 50% Greater than $10,000 per capita GDP 40% 36% Source: S&P/IFC, EIU, World Bank. GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 5 Exhibit 4 Growth: Demographics Play An Important Role Improvement in Demographics Has Played a Signifi cant Role in Increased Growth Rates Conversely, as baby boomers retire in the developed world, the dependency ratio will worsen and there will be fewer workers (as a proportion of the population) and the overall number of hours worked will decrease. The overall global effect will be to shift consumption (as a result of increasing income) from the developed world to the emerging world. Economic Changes + Demographic Shift = Huge Increase in Consumer Base With these global shifts in economics and demographics upon us, the focus of economic activity is likely to shift toward domestic demand providers within emerging markets. Exhibit 5 shows the number of people that one might term “middle class” (defi ned as having an income greater than $6,000) that will be added to the emerging markets over the next fi ve years (assuming the continuation of current growth rates). This number is far greater than the current population of the United States. We are very confi dent that, absent some global catastrophe, domestic demand in emerging market countries will be robust over the next few years, irrespective of what may or may not happen in the developed world. So, what could derail this story? The most likely candidate is oil rising to $200/barrel and staying there for an extended period. In general, very high commodity prices would have a major impact on consumption in emerging markets, and would shift potential return from domestic demand companies to commodity producers. * Percent of non-working to working people. Source: United Nations 6 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Exhibit 5 If Current Trends Persist, the Emerging Middle Class Will Increase by around 500 Million People in the Next 5 Years How Does One Take Advantage of This? Recently, we’ve been asked by a number of our clients if this anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue – the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities. At this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets and thus most multinationals do not represent a “pure play” on emerging domestic demand. For example, if we screen the MS World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50% of their sales from emerging markets, we fi nd 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574 billion and make up only 2.1% of the market value of the MSCI World Index. Exhibit 6 shows the 10 largest companies in this group – not exactly the household names one expects to see. -370 463 80 -500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Less than $6,000 (Below Middle Class) $6,000 to $30,000 (Middle Class) More Than $30,000 Millions Emerging Markets – Change in Consumer Base 2010-2015 70% of Europe Population Source: Goldman Sachs, World Bank GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 7 Exhibit 6 In addition, our view is that locally-domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home-fi eld advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from numerous sources, including high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well-established local brands, government policies that tend to favor locals, and the fact that local competitors are likely to have high profi tability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend – rather than build – their market share. A good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to be able to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia, it would be extremely expensive. In addition, they would have great diffi culty competing against a well-established player such as Magnit, which runs 4,000 plus stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20% (both of which allow it to make life very diffi cult for new entrants). We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build out its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where they paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefi ts of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future. This is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long-standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in countries like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profi tability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally-listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade-off between “pure-play” and valuation. For example, Domino’s Pizza has a market cap of $1.6 billion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3 billion, despite contributing less than 10% of the sales and 18% of the profi ts of the overall company. If our thesis of home fi eld advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past 5 years. Exhibit 7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive from a valuation point of view relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit 8 shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason domestic emerging companies outperformed was because their earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion. Name Country Market Value ($M) % Sales to EM QUALCOMM Inc.

As of 7/31/11 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 9 At the end of the day (as we mentioned earlier), it’s not about multinationals versus locals, but which companies are able to best take advantage of the large growth in demand. What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profi ts that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we fi nd that the best (but not all) opportunities are local. Not All Domestic Opportunities Are Attractive Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Similarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profi tability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profi tability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15 million net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profi tability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. Thus, high growth in this sector is unlikely to translate into high returns for shareholders. On the other hand, the fi nancial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well-established, highly profi table banks. Only 2% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefi t from this growth without having to lower their margins. The key is to look for fast-growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows for players to have high profi tability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profi tability in the face of non-linear demand increases are most attractive. Profi tability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter. In GMO parlance – focus on quality within fast-growing country/sectors. Conclusions As a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe that we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in the emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be refl ected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers. The winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home-fi eld advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well-established, high quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast-growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.

(Please provide a detailed analysis) What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, Stays in Emerging Arjun Divecha The Opportunity We have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets. In the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4 trillion and daily trading volume of around $40 billion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets. While there are many ways to segment emerging markets – by region, big cap vs. small cap, value vs. growth

Question
What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: China and Beyond China Arjun Divecha
From China to Beyond China
China has become less attractive. Is it time to move beyond China? The answer is yes, but with caution. The Chinese economy is slowing down and the government is trying to manage the debt burden. The government is also trying to manage the property market and the debt burden of property developers. The property market is a big part of the Chinese economy and it is under pressure. The government is trying to manage the debt burden of property developers and the property market.

(Please provide a detailed analysis) What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: China and Beyond China Arjun Divecha From China to Beyond China China has become less attractive. Is this cyclical or secular? Yes Supply chains are moving out of China for multiple reasons. Who is benefiting from these moves? How does one take advantage of this secular shift? One can see this playing out in multiple ways. First, is the obvious beneficiary which is nearshoring to China. Mainly Mexico and Southeast Asia. Companies that serve this shift in supply chains will benefit. An example of this is JBLU. Second, is the more distant “Beyond China” opportunity. As supply chains move out of China, they are moving to multiple destinations. This creates an opportunity for companies that serve these new destinations. An example of this is TGT. Finally, there is the onshoring opportunity. As a result of the new destination being the US, companies that benefit from domestic manufacturing and consumption will benefit. An example of this is AMZN. Obviously, this is a work in progress and one should not expect to have it right the first time. One needs to constantly update their thesis as new information becomes available. One gets a clue that their work is being noticed when the establishment starts to take notice. April 2024 update: It is interesting to see the “establishment” trying to create a narrative that China is becoming more attractive. HBS did a survey of CEOs

ADAPTER RESPONSE:
(Please provide a detailed analysis) | 2 WHAT’S GOING ON IN CHINA | 3 CHINA’S ECONOMY HAS NOT FALLEN APART, BUT . . . GDP growth has slowed Stock market has been volatile Currency has depreciated Real estate prices have fallen Excess capacity in many industries | 4 WHY HAS GROWTH SLOWED? Demographics – the shrinking of the labor force Shift from manufacturing to services – which is inherently less capital intensive One off factors – the break up of the Soviet Union and the associated loss of trade with former Soviet states, the impact of the global financial crisis, etc. | 5 HOW DOES THIS SLOWDOWN AFFECT INVESTORS? First, it creates uncertainty Second, the government is likely to undertake major stimulus efforts, which create their own risks and opportunities | 6 SO, WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT? We have reduced our overall exposure to China We are focusing on companies that benefit from government stimulus We are closely monitoring real estate and related industries as they are very vulnerable | 7 IN SUMMARY China is not dead, nor is it the same as it was during the 2000s Investing in China requires nuance and care We are taking steps to protect our clients’ assets while positioning for a potential pickup in economic activity

GMO North America | Europe | Australasia Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 “Dude, Where’s My Alpha?” Arjun Divecha Over the last 4 years we’ve experienced a glorious value rally in emerging markets (for both cheap countries and stocks). As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. Given that we are primarily value investors, the narrowing of spreads would appear to reduce our ability to add value in the short to medium term. We examine the contraction of value at the country level, the contraction of value at the stock level, what we’re doing about it, and what we think you should do about it. Country Selection – How Cheap Are Cheap Countries Relative to Expensive Countries? Chart 1 shows the valuation of the cheapest countries relative to the most expensive countries. In normal times, cheap countries trade at 78% of the valuation of expensive countries, or at a 22% discount. Right now, this discount has narrowed to 15%. Does this mean that cheap countries will do badly? Not necessarily. They were at a similar discount 2 years ago and value has worked very well for country selection since then. On the other hand, when they were at similar valuations in mid 1998 (during the latter half of the Asia crisis), cheap countries had their worst relative underperformance over the next 12 months. What this means in our view is that the opportunity to add value by buying cheap countries has diminished, but has not disappeared. More importantly, the risk of buying cheap countries has risen.

It’s important to note that while value is an important part of our country selection discipline (with a 45% weight in our country assessment model), it is not the only metric we use to determine country attractiveness. Momentum, Macroeconomics and Judgment form 55% of our country selection model and we have no evidence to show that they are poorly positioned to deliver outperformance right now. In addition, our work on currency vulnerability shows that very few emerging economies are currently vulnerable to an economic shock, lessening the probability of economic contagion. We normally run our country selection process at a tracking error of around 8%. In the face of diminished expectations and increased risk, it seems prudent to reduce our overall country bets, so we will be taking down the tracking error from 8% to around 6%. Thus, our current overweight of Brazil will decrease from the current 9.5% to about 7%, with similar changes in all our country bets. Stock Picking Within Country – How Cheap Are Value and Small Cap Stocks? Looking at how stocks are positioned within markets, one sees a similar picture. Chart 2 shows how cheap “value” stocks have been over time, relative to the index. What this chart shows is that value stocks usually trade at a 40% discount to the index, but are currently at a 34% discount, the narrowest we’ve seen in the 15-year history for which we have data. In going from a 46% discount in October 2000 to a 34% discount today, value massively outperformed. In the last few months we have seen a similar contraction in the positioning of value in the U.S. and developed markets, but not to uncharted waters, which is where we are now in Emerging. The question to ask now is, if the discount has narrowed to 34%, does this mean that value will do badly (after all it’s still at a 34% discount)? Chart 2: How Cheap Are Value Stocks? Value Stocks are Relatively Expensive 0.52 0.54 0.56 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Value of Cheap Stocks Relative to Benchmark October 2000: 46% Discount Current: 34% Discount Narrow Spread Wide Spread Normally Trade at 40% Discount to Market Jan- Source: GMO Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 3 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia We have no data to tell us how value does when the discount narrows to this extent, but one thing we can say for sure – it’s unlikely to be a good thing. So, if value isn’t attractive, what is? Let’s first look at small cap stocks. Given that smallness tends to be correlated with cheapness, one should expect that they’re not as cheap as they usually are either. That’s exactly what Chart 3 shows – the discount on small caps has narrowed from an all time high of 32% in October 2000 to 12% today. This narrowing of the spread in both value and small occurred because both did extremely well over the past 4 years, greatly helping our performance. What Are We Doing About It? The question we ask ourselves is, “If value is not well positioned, is there something else that is, or has the fishing just gotten poorer overall?” We first looked at “growth” stocks, based on companies that are forecast to have the highest earnings growth over 2 years. As one would expect, this group usually trades at a premium to the market, but as Chart 4 shows, they have not become more attractive as value has become less attractive. Another group of stocks we follow quite closely is high quality stocks (see Chart 5). This sector appears to be the most attractively priced opportunity in the market today.

In the U.S. and developed markets, quality has been priced cheaper and performed better than finance theory suggests it should. Similarly, in emerging markets, this group of stocks usually trades at a mere 9% premium to the market. More excitingly right now, we can pick up these profitable, stable, low-debt companies at the same multiple (i.e., no premium) as the rest of the market today. Over the past 2 years, we have been working on a new measure of value that incorporates quality and had been planning to replace our current “Value” model for stock picking with a new “Quality-Adjusted-Value” model later this year. However, given the positioning of both value and quality, we started transitioning our stock selection process to this new model in May 2004. Chart 5: Quality Is Relatively Cheap 0.85 0.95 1.05 1.15 1.25 1.35 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Currently: 0% Premium Normally Trade at 9% Premium to Market Jan- Source: GMO Chart 4: How Attractive Are Growth* Stocks? 0.52 0.72 0.92 1.12 1.32 1.52 1.72 1.92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 Jan- * Non-loss making companies that are forecast to have the highest 2 year growth Source: GMO Currently: 31% Premium Normally Trade at 23% Premium to Market Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 5 GMO North America | Europe | Australasia In the new model, we explicitly adjust the attractiveness of a stock for its quality. One ramification is that the amount of quality we own in the portfolio is related to how attractive quality stocks are on a valuation basis. Thus, this change will have the effect of increasing our bet on quality right now, while reducing the bet on what one might consider “junky” value stocks. It will also have the effect of increasing the average size of company we own; given that small caps are no longer attractive, we are very comfortable with this change. In general we are very excited about this new “Quality-Adjusted-Value” model, and we will be writing more about it in the next Emerging Thoughts. Finally, as in country selection, value is not the only strategy we use to pick stocks. 70% of our process is value and 30% is momentum. The attractiveness of momentum is not affected by the positioning of value (that’s precisely why we use both strategies – to diversify each other). Overall, the changes we are making will make us less vulnerable to a downturn in value investing at both the country level and the stock level, but we cannot pretend that we’ll sleep much easier. What Should You Do About This? So, when you hear from us that our ability to add value is diminished, what’s the appropriate response? When we look at valuations for the asset class, we see that emerging markets are at approximately fair value. One option would be to reduce your overall bet on emerging, assuming you are overweight the asset class (like most of our clients). However, emerging equities are one of the most attractive of all asset classes, based on our asset allocation group’s 7-year forecast, and GMO is quite heavily overweight emerging equities in all of our asset allocation products. Another response would be to take money away from us and give it to another emerging manager. However, as far as we can tell, this contraction of value has not led to greater opportunities popping up elsewhere. Thus, moving money away from us (or any other value manager) to a different style does not seem to be compelling enough to justify the high transaction costs. Those of you who have been with us for a while have enjoyed the value and small rally. While we try to deliver outperformance of 4% a year, for calendar year end 2003 the GMO Emerging Markets Strategy outperformed its benchmark, the S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index1, by 13.1% after outperforming by 4.7% in 2002 and 8.1% in 2001. So, if the compression of value does lead to tougher times for our strategy in the next couple of years, at least you were able to reap the benefits of that compression along the way. We’re battening down the hatches and searching hard for opportunities that might be out there, but we have entered uncharted territory and there don’t seem to be any easy answers. We will continue to do the best job we can for you, but it may just be time to grit your teeth, tighten your buckle, and hang on for what could be a difficult ride. 1 The S&P/IFC Investable Composite Index is an independently maintained and published emerging market stock index.

GMO North America | Europe | Australasia Emerging Thoughts – May 2004 "Dude, Where's My Alpha?" Arjus P. Patel, CFA
The title of this paper is a play on the movie "Dude, Where's My Car?" The premise of the movie is that the two leads, The Dude and Walter, have a very good time at a party and wake up the next day with no memory of what happened. The Dude is convinced that if he can just find his car, he will find out what happened. The movie is about the search for the car and the journey that The Dude and Walter go on to find it. The title of this paper is similar in spirit. The premise is that investors have been getting very good returns for many years and are now trying to figure out why they have been getting such good returns and whether they can continue. The question is, "Where's my alpha?" The answer is that investors have been getting alpha, but not from the sources they think they are getting it from. The paper is about figuring out where the alpha is really coming from and whether it is sustainable.

As a result of this rally, spreads between cheap and expensive countries and stocks in emerging markets have narrowed. We examine the history of past narrowing cycles to ascertain how they have played out and what it might mean for the future. Our past research has indicated that narrowing cycles in emerging markets are usually short-lived and are often followed by a sharp widening (or “corrective”) phase. This narrowing in spreads usually reflects a shift in investor sentiment from value-based considerations to growth-based considerations. In short, when growth wins, value loses. In the current environment, with central banks accommodating and inflation low, it makes sense that growth would be favored. After all, high inflation is the enemy of growth and the nightmare scenario for growth-oriented investors. So with growth winning, does this mean value is doomed? Not necessarily. As value becomes more out of favor, it becomes more attractively priced. Eventually, economic cycles play out and growth slows down. When that happens, investors will shift their focus back to value. In short, growth wins in the short run, value wins in the long run. This shift from value to growth is not limited to emerging markets; we see the

EXPECTED ANSWER:
GMO WHITE PAPER August 2011 Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun... What Happens in Emerging, Stays in Emerging Arjun Divecha The Opportunity We have been managing money in emerging markets for nearly 18 years and it has been fascinating to see changes in not only where opportunities to make money could be found, but also in how the nature of those opportunities has evolved. Back in the 1990s, companies that did best were those that were export oriented, as outsourcing became an established phenomenon. During the 2000s, as commodity prices rose steeply, it was the commodity producers that did extremely well. Now, with economics and demographics moving away from developed markets, we believe we are in the early stages of another major shift, toward companies that serve domestic demand within emerging markets. In the past, emerging markets were too small and illiquid to allow investors to commit substantial assets to narrow strategies, but in recent years, emerging markets have increased in size and liquidity to the extent that it now makes little sense to view them as a monolithic asset class. With an investable market cap of $4 trillion and daily trading volume of around $40 billion, emerging markets are rapidly approaching the size and liquidity of developed markets. While there are many ways to segment emerging markets – by region, big cap vs. small cap, value vs. growth – we believe a more appropriate segmentation is to think about companies based on the ultimate customers they serve. Within this view, we see businesses as belonging to one of three distinct groups: exporters, global commodity producers, and those that serve domestic demand in the form of consumption and infrastructure. In recent years, there has been much talk about the coupling/decoupling of emerging markets vis-à-vis the developed world. We fi nd this either/or characterization misses the mark when, in fact, the reality is far more complicated. Perhaps a better way to think about growth in emerging markets is to characterize it as having two components: correlated growth, which is driven by links with the developed world, and uncorrelated growth, which depends more on the internal dynamics and demographics of the emerging markets themselves. From this viewpoint, exporters and global commodity producers largely represent correlated growth, while domestic demand mostly represents uncorrelated growth. Obviously, in a globalized world, there is a large overlap between these two, with both positive and negative feedback loops. However, in light of an economic environment in the developed world that seems increasingly vulnerable to a “seven lean years” scenario, we think the case for investing in domestic demand is particularly strong relative to other segments within emerging markets because domestic demand represents a “pure play” on the economic growth of these countries. The Case for Domestic Demand Looking at the prospects for each of these segments separately, it is hard to see how companies that export primarily to the developed world can do well unless economic growth in the developed world picks up. Given the large debt burdens prevalent in most major developed economies, it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S., Europe, or Japan will experience high economic growth rates over the next few years. Thus, for exporters to do well, they would have to take market share from both developed and emerging competitors. In addition, because they compete globally, margins are likely to be squeezed by having to go toe-to-toe with well-capitalized global competitors. 2 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Global commodity producers may continue to do well (as they have over the previous decade) if commodity prices stay high or rise even further. For most institutional investors, it makes sense to have an overall commodity strategy with commodity producers from emerging markets in the mix. However, we do not believe that they represent an emerging “pure play” as they are driven by global rather than purely emerging market forces. The main case for the domestic demand story today (as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago) is based on the confl uence of two forces: economics and demographics. The Economic Case The economic case is predicated on a high proportion of emerging market countries arriving at the “sweet spot,” where increases in income cause consumption to rise steeply. As poor countries begin to get richer, citizens faced with an uncertain future save as much as they can, especially when they cannot reasonably expect society to provide for them. For example, we have seen savings rates in emerging markets rise from 13% of GDP in the early 1980s to nearly 35% today (see Exhibit 1). Exhibit 1 Savings Rates Have Risen with Income in Emerging Markets However, once per capita GDP levels reach the range of $3,000 to $10,000, consumption rises and savings rates inevitably drop. We believe that this occurs for two reasons. First, at these levels of national wealth, societies become rich enough to start providing social safety nets. Second, individuals have newfound discretionary income, which they increasingly spend on consumer goods. Savings rates tend to peak around this “sweet spot” of $3,000 to $10,000 per capita GDP and then drop. Exhibit 2 shows this pattern in a number of developed markets as they became richer. In recent years, we have seen the same pattern repeated in emerging markets such as Korea, Taiwan, Israel, etc. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 Savings Rate Mean Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 3 Exhibit 2 However, Savings Rates Drop Dramatically When GDP/Capita Reaches the $3,000-$10,000 Range We've Seen This in Developed Markets at a Similar Stage of Development Korea Savings Rate vs. Per Capita GDP 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Portugal 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Japan -20 0 20 40 60 80 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Greece 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 0 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000 Savings Rate GDP/Capita Australia 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 $0 $5,000 $10,000 $15,000 $20,000 $25,000 Savings Rate Source: Bloomberg, World Bank, GMO 4 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 What makes consumption in emerging markets particularly interesting today is that over 50% of emerging market countries (by market cap) are in this sweet spot (Exhibit 3). This was not the case 10 years ago, or even 5 years ago. Thus, if economic growth remains strong in emerging markets, one can reasonably expect to see large increases in the number of consumers and, therefore, discretionary spending. Exhibit 3 50% of Emerging Countries Are Now in the Sweet Spot of Shifting from Savings to Consumption While a number of sell-side analysts suggest that this story is already well-known and priced into markets, we beg to differ. We believe when incomes reach this sweet spot, the elasticity of demand becomes highly non-linear, where small increases in per capita income lead to large increases in consumption. A simple example can be seen in Chinese auto sales. In the year 2000, Chinese crossed $1,000 per capita GDP. In that year, auto sales fi rst exceeded 1 million vehicles. Ten years later, Chinese GDP more than quadrupled, to $4,400 per capita. What happened to auto sales? Did they go from 1 million to 4 million? No. They went from 1 million to 17 million! No analyst that we know of predicted anything close to these numbers. It’s very diffi cult to forecast this kind of growth, so high growth forecasts tend to be 20% to 30% at each point in time, followed by upward revisions on a regular basis. As a result of these factors, we are reasonably confi dent that per capita consumption in emerging market countries will rise substantially in the next few years and that much of this consumption growth is not anticipated by markets. The Demographic Shift What makes an already good story potentially explosive is the fact that demographics are not static and indicate that the number of people in their prime working (and consuming) years will also rise dramatically in the next few years (both in absolute terms and relative to the developed markets). Exhibit 4 shows the dependency ratio, which is defi ned as the ratio of non-working-age to working-age people in both the emerging and developed markets. As the downward sloping line shows, demographics in emerging markets have improved dramatically over the last few years (with the dependency ratio falling) and they will remain in this sweet spot for the next few decades. What this means is that the number of people that are working relative to those not working has dramatically improved and will remain there for the next 20 to 30 years. (Obviously, this is not true for all emerging market countries. Eastern Europe’s and China’s dependency ratios deteriorate quite rapidly over the next 25 years, while those of India, Indonesia, and Turkey improve.) Weight in S&P/IFCI Composite Index 2005 2010 Less than $3,000 per capita GDP 19% 13% Between $3,000 and $10,000 per capita GDP 41% 50% Greater than $10,000 per capita GDP 40% 36% Source: S&P/IFC, EIU, World Bank. GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 5 Exhibit 4 Growth: Demographics Play An Important Role Improvement in Demographics Has Played a Signifi cant Role in Increased Growth Rates Conversely, as baby boomers retire in the developed world, the dependency ratio will worsen and there will be fewer workers (as a proportion of the population) and the overall number of hours worked will decrease. The overall global effect will be to shift consumption (as a result of increasing income) from the developed world to the emerging world. Economic Changes + Demographic Shift = Huge Increase in Consumer Base With these global shifts in economics and demographics upon us, the focus of economic activity is likely to shift toward domestic demand providers within emerging markets. Exhibit 5 shows the number of people that one might term “middle class” (defi ned as having an income greater than $6,000) that will be added to the emerging markets over the next fi ve years (assuming the continuation of current growth rates). This number is far greater than the current population of the United States. We are very confi dent that, absent some global catastrophe, domestic demand in emerging market countries will be robust over the next few years, irrespective of what may or may not happen in the developed world. So, what could derail this story? The most likely candidate is oil rising to $200/barrel and staying there for an extended period. In general, very high commodity prices would have a major impact on consumption in emerging markets, and would shift potential return from domestic demand companies to commodity producers. * Percent of non-working to working people. Source: United Nations 6 GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 Exhibit 5 If Current Trends Persist, the Emerging Middle Class Will Increase by around 500 Million People in the Next 5 Years How Does One Take Advantage of This? Recently, we’ve been asked by a number of our clients if this anticipated growth in demand in emerging economies is best captured by investing in multinational companies or in domestic companies within emerging markets. In the long term, our view is that this is not an either/or issue – the ideal portfolio should be indifferent to domicile, but focus on which companies are best able to take advantage of these opportunities. At this point in time, however, we believe the more interesting opportunities are in companies domiciled within emerging markets. Currently, there are very few multinational companies that derive a substantial part of their revenue or income from emerging markets and thus most multinationals do not represent a “pure play” on emerging domestic demand. For example, if we screen the MS World Index universe for companies that derive at least 50% of their sales from emerging markets, we fi nd 183 companies that match. These 183 companies have a total market value of $574 billion and make up only 2.1% of the market value of the MSCI World Index. Exhibit 6 shows the 10 largest companies in this group – not exactly the household names one expects to see. -370 463 80 -500 -400 -300 -200 -100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Less than $6,000 (Below Middle Class) $6,000 to $30,000 (Middle Class) More Than $30,000 Millions Emerging Markets – Change in Consumer Base 2010-2015 70% of Europe Population Source: Goldman Sachs, World Bank GMO Emerging Consumers Just Want to Have Fun – August 2011 7 Exhibit 6 In addition, our view is that locally-domiciled companies in emerging markets have substantial home-fi eld advantages relative to foreign companies at this point in time. These advantages come from numerous sources, including high barriers to entry, the expenses associated with building brand awareness relative to well-established local brands, government policies that tend to favor locals, and the fact that local competitors are likely to have high profi tability and substantial economies of scale that make it easy for them to defend – rather than build – their market share. A good example is the Russian retail sector. For a foreign entrant like Walmart or Carrefour to be able to acquire land, build stores, and establish supply chains in Russia, it would be extremely expensive. In addition, they would have great diffi culty competing against a well-established player such as Magnit, which runs 4,000 plus stores across all Russian regions and has a return on equity north of 20% (both of which allow it to make life very diffi cult for new entrants). We believe it makes more sense for Walmart to buy Magnit rather than try to build out its own chain of stores in Russia. In fact, Walmart has done precisely that in South Africa, where they paid a large premium to acquire a majority stake in MassMart, a local retailer. Thus, one of the fringe benefi ts of investing in dominant local players is the optionality of being bought out at a premium at some point in the future. This is not to say that multinationals cannot be as successful as domestic companies in local markets. In cases where multinationals have a long-standing presence and have adapted their product and distribution strategies to suit local conditions, they can be very successful. For example, Unilever has had local operations in countries like India, Indonesia, and Nigeria for many decades and has established astonishingly high profi tability in each market. In some cases, it makes more sense to buy the locally-listed subsidiary of the multinational, and in others to buy the global company, based on the trade-off between “pure-play” and valuation. For example, Domino’s Pizza has a market cap of $1.6 billion, while its Indian subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks has a market cap of $1.3 billion, despite contributing less than 10% of the sales and 18% of the profi ts of the overall company. If our thesis of home fi eld advantage is correct, one should expect emerging domestic companies to have outperformed multinationals in recent times. Indeed, that has been the case over the past 5 years. Exhibit 7 shows the performance of domestic emerging and developed multinationals stocks. One might conclude from this outperformance that emerging domestic companies might now be expensive from a valuation point of view relative to developed multinationals. Exhibit 8 shows that despite the large outperformance, emerging domestic stocks trade at a slight discount to multinationals. The reason domestic emerging companies outperformed was because their earnings grew faster, not because of valuation expansion. Name Country Market Value ($M) % Sales to EM QUALCOMM Inc.

What we care about is not overall GDP growth or even revenue growth; what matters are profi ts that companies are able to make and distribute to their shareholders. At this point in time, we fi nd that the best (but not all) opportunities are local. Not All Domestic Opportunities Are Attractive Attractive domestic opportunities are not evenly distributed across countries, and within countries where they are present, some sectors are far more attractive than others. At the country level, countries with large populations that are in the sweet spot of consumption growth (e.g., India, Indonesia, Brazil, China) are more attractive than countries that are already relatively developed (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, Israel). Similarly, not all sectors within these countries are attractive. Some sectors have a competitive structure that prevents high profi tability. Indian telecom, for example, is a sector with very high sales growth, but the competitive structure of the industry does not allow for high profi tability. While India adds an astonishing 10 to 15 million net new subscribers each month, there are 15 companies competing in this space so profi tability is low and likely to remain so until there is a fair amount of consolidation. Thus, high growth in this sector is unlikely to translate into high returns for shareholders. On the other hand, the fi nancial sector in India is more attractive because the nature of competition is highly oligopolistic, with high barriers to entry and well-established, highly profi table banks. Only 2% of Indians have credit cards, and one can reasonably expect this number to double in the next few years. Thus, banks with established brands and branch networks should benefi t from this growth without having to lower their margins. The key is to look for fast-growing country/sector combinations where the nature of competition is such that it allows for players to have high profi tability. Within these country/sectors, companies that have a proven franchise that will allow them to command high profi tability in the face of non-linear demand increases are most attractive. Profi tability, brand, franchise, supply chain, and experience matter. In GMO parlance – focus on quality within fast-growing country/sectors. Conclusions As a result of economic and demographic changes, we believe that we are in the middle of a major shift in global demand patterns. More of the hours worked, more of the money earned, and therefore more of the money spent will be located in the emerging markets. Inevitably, this will be refl ected in the earnings and valuations of companies that serve emerging consumers. The winners will likely be drawn from both the developed and emerging markets, although our view is that over the next several years, locally domiciled companies within emerging markets have an edge due to various home-fi eld advantages. Not all countries and sectors provide the same opportunities. Well-established, high quality companies that have a sustainable edge in fast-growing country/sectors are likely to be the big winners.

QUESTION 15:
What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective Contrary to popular belid investing in emevging markets...

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective Contrary to popular belid investing in emevging markets can actually reduce risk. Arjun B. Divecha, Jaime Drach, and Dan Stefek ARJUN B. DIVECHA is the Director of Information Technolo- gy Services at BARRA, Inc. in Berkeley (CA 94704). JAIME DRACH is a Senior Con- sultant at BARRA. DAN STEFEK is a Senior Con- sultant at BARRA. oaring returns and sanguine prospects for eco- nomic growth have fueled a recent surge of S interest in investing in “emerging” markets. Such markets have become more accessible to the global investor. Today, there are several country funds through which investors can participate in even “closed” or restricted markets. Investment wdl become easier as more countries dismantle barriers to direct foreign investment. This article presents recent research into the emerging markets from a quantitative point of view. We have developed a model for understanding the forces that drive these markets, which affords some insights for global investors. We find that while the emerging markets are more volatile than developed markets, they tend to be relatively uncorrelated with each other and with developed markets. Thus, contrary to popular belief, modest investment in the emerging markets leads to lower, rather than higher, portfolio risk for the glob- al investor (see also Brown [1991]). Over the past five years, a global investor who put 20% in an emerging markets index fund would have reduced overall annual portfolio risk from 18.3% to 17.5% while increasing annual return from 12.6% to 14.7%. One unexpected result of our research is that stock returns in the emerging markets tend to be more homogeneous than in developed markets, implying that a strong market force dominates industry and stock-specific influences. In short, when the market moves, everyone goes along for the ride. FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 41 WHICH MARKETS ARE CONSIDERED EMERGING MARKETS? EXHIBIT 1 Emerging Market Characteristics Just what is considered an emerging market is frequently a matter of opinion. Narrowly defined, an emerging market: 0 Has securities that trade in a public market. Is not a developed market (as defined by countries covered within the Morgan Stanley Capital Inter- national Indices or Financial Times Indices). Is of interest to global institutional investors. Has a reliable source of data. 0 Exhibit 1 lists the countries that we consider to be ernerging markets. They fall into three regions: Asia, Latin America, and Europe/Middle East/Africa. Singapore and Hong Kong fall into most definitions of developed markets, but are included here because they are closely related to the other Asian markets. Colom- bia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, and Zimbabwe are not of great institutional interest at present, although Pak- istan has recently opened up its economy and financial markets to foreign investors and may well be next on the list of emerging markets to attract institutional interest. Finally, Japanese over-the-counter (OTC) stocks are included in the list because they tend to behave (and are perceived) differently from listed Japanese st:ocks. R E T W I S AND RISKS OF EMERGING MARKETS The casual reader of the financial press knows there have been stories of incredible returns (high and low) in the emerging markets. The Venezuelan stock market was up about 450% in U.S. dollar terms during 1990. On the other hand, the Taiwanese Stock Exchange Index started out 1990 at about the 5,000 level, went up to 12,600 during the first quarter and collapsed 110 near 2,500 during the third quarter. What makes this even more interesting is that the Taiwanese market is only the fourth or fifth most risky emerging market! During the first half of 1991, Latin American countries dominated all others; in U.S. dollar terms, they were up over 100%. Overall, the emerging markets have done better than the 'developed markets over the past five years.

International Finance Corporations (IFC) Emerging Markets Composite Index was 19.7%, aj compared to 12.6% for the Financial Times World Index.' Exhibit 1 shows predicted risks according to BARRA's risk model of each of the emerging markets as well as for a few developed markets. Clearly, these 42 EMERGINZ MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 markets are extremely risky when compared with developed markets. Apart from the obvious risks (political instability, insider trading, etc.), there are a number of possible reasons why these markets are extremely volatile. First, they tend to be fairly concentrated; that is, the larger stocks have a high proportion of the over- all market capitalization. As a result, there are fewer opportunities for diversification, and returns to these large stocks dominate the overall market return. Sec- ond, unlike the developed markets, which tend to have forces that affect diverse sectors of the economy differ- ently, the emerging markets tend to have a strong mar- ket-related force that affects all stocks within a market. This tends to accentuate volatility. There are some apparent anomalies in these results. Palustan, Jordan, Colombia, Nigeria, and Zim- babwe appear to have had relatively low risk over the last five years. We believe that these low figures reflect the lack of liquidity in these markets, so observed volatilities (and correlations with other markets) must be viewed with caution. When we look at the turnover ratio (value tradedlmarket capitalization) for each market, we find that these five markets rank in the bottom six (shown in Exhibit 1). The real volatility is likely to be much higher, if and when these markets become more liquid. When we look at the emerging markets as a group (the BARRA Emerging World Universe of about 4,000 stocks), we find that it has much lower volatility than most of the individual markets. This is because of low correlations between these markets. The diversification that these low correlations offer the global investor is one of the biggest benefits of invest- ing in the emerging markets. The volatility (over the past five years) of the BARRA Emerging World Uni- verse was about 28.0%, as compared to about 18.8% for the S&P 500 or 22.8% for the Morgan Stanley Europe, Australia, and the Far East (EAFE) index. A MODEL TO UNDERSTAND RISK AND RETURN To analyze risk and return in these markets, we developed a multi-factor model similar to one previous- ly constructed for the developed markets (see Grinold, Rudd, and Stefek [1989]). At the core of the model is a hierarchical decomposition of portfolio return into vari- ous components. This is dustrated in E h b i t 2. EXHIBIT 2 EMERGING MARKETS MODEL We focus on excess return, return beyond the risk-free rate. This return is initially broken down into currency return and excess return earned in local mar- kets. Local excess return is decomposed further into country factor return, industry return, and return accruing to salient attributes of the companies in the portfolio, e.g. the price/earnings ratio. These latter sources of return are called risk indexes. The return to a global portfolio depends on the numeraire or home country of the investor. More pre- cisely, the excess return to an investment abroad is the product of the return of the investment in its local market, 1 + r1, and the exchange return 1 + r,. With a little manipulation, this can be expressed as the sum of three components: Excess Numeraire Return = (r, + rfl - rd - (ri - rfl) + r, x q, or, (1) Currency Return - Local Excess Return + Cross-Product where rf is the risk-free rate of return in the country of the investor, and rfl is the risk-free rate in the market where the investment is being made. The first term in Equation (1) is the currency return, reflecting both the exchange return and the differential in interest rates between countries. The second term is the local excess return of the investment in its own market. The final term, r, x r1 (also known as the cross- product) poses a problem for development of a linear model. For most countries, this cross-product term is FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 43 typically small and can be disregarded for the purposes of forecasting risk. For example, ignoring the cross- product reduces the annual risk of the Korean market by 51 basis points (from 29.62% to 29.11%), and of the Taiwanese market by 103 basis points. In such cases, one can sa.fely ignore the cross-product because it is small relative to overall market risk. This is not true for Argentina or Brazil, where there are huge swings in exchange rates. Over the past five years, ignoring the cross-product would have changed the annual risk of the Argentinean market by 17% and the Brazilian market by 4%. To circumvent this difficulty, we do not try to decompose the Brazilian and Argentinean asset returns into local and currency components but rather model these assets from the U.S. perspective. In other words, we trans1at:e the prices of Brazilian and Argentinean assets into U.S. dollars and model the U.S. dollar- denomina,ted returns of these assets. Happily, this approach :is consistent with investors’ tendency to think of these assets in U.S. dollars. Next, local excess return is broken down into three components: country factor return, industry return, and risk index return. The amount of an asset’s riturn arising from each component depends on its exposure to that source. The exposure of an asset to the country factor is its beta with respect to that mar- ket. Moreover, assets are exposed only to their own local markets. In contrast, industry and risk indexes are global factors in the model, i.e., it is assumed that these factors apply equally across countries. Industry exposure is defined using the Financial Times Wcdd industry classification. Each asset is assigned to exactly one of the thirty-six industry cate- gories. The risk indexes include size, success, yield, variability in markets, earnings-to-price ratio, book- to-price ra.tio, and liquidity. Exposures to these risk indexes are normalized within each country. Thus, these exposures measure how an asset compAres to the rest of its local market. A formal statement of our model for monthly local excess return is for asset n: Local Excess = Country Factor + Industry Factor + Risk Index Factor + Specific Return 44 EMERGING MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE where asset n the ith f(i) are k = 1, number of countries j = 1, number of industries i = 1, number of risk indexes P(n,k), y(n,j), and x(n,i) are the exposures of to the kth country factor, the jth industry, and risk index, respectively. Variables h(k), g(j), and returns to these factors. In estimating the factor returns, the exposures are determined from the begin- ning of month data. The part of the return that is not explained by these factors is called the specific return, u(n); it is unique to the company. The model was estimated for assets fbrn the twen- ty-three markets listed in Exhibit 1 over the period Febru- ary 1986 to July 1991. Data are drawn from numerous sources includmg the International Finance Corporation and proprietary sources in thirteen countries. The results of the modeling process reveal some interesting differences between emerging and devel- oped markets. The overall proportion of variance explained by the emerging markets model (adjusted R2 ) is 50%, as compared with 38% for a :similar model that covers the developed markets (countries covered by the Financial Times Indices). At first glance it may seem surprising that a quantitative model would explain a greater proportion of return in the emerging markets than the developed markets. In order to understand this further, we looked at two submodels. The first submodel was built using only indus- try factors; i.e., we looked at what proportion of return is explained by the industry that a company is in, ignoring the country factors and :risk indexes. Thus, a definition of this model is: (3) Local Excess Return = Industry Fa.ctor + Specific Return We find the adjusted R2 for this rnodel for the emerging markets to be 16%, compared with 22% for the developed markets. This is a measure of how “global” or integrated industries are across countries. It stands to reason that the developed rnarkets have industries that are better integrated than the emerging ones, but the fact that the difference is small implies that there are cross-country industry commonalities in the emerging markets as well. The second submodel was built using only FALL 1992 country factors. Thus, we looked at what proportion of return is explained by country factors alone, ignor- ing the industry factor and risk indexes. The definition of this model is: Local Excess Return = Country Factor + Specific Return The adjusted R2 for this model for the emerg- ing markets is 46% compared with 30% for the devel- oped markets. Clearly, this country factor is the major force driving emerging markets. As one would expect, industries play a larger part in explaining return in the developed markets, while country differences play a larger role in the emerging markets. HOMOGENEITY WITHIN MARKETS The fact that country factors explain such a large proportion of variance (in absolute terms and when compared with the developed markets) in the emerging markets bears a closer look. That is, stock returns tend to be more homogeneous (within a market) in the emerging markets than in developed markets. In other words, when the market moves, there is a strong ten- dency for all stocks in the market to move with it. This difference in the proportion of return explained by the market factor (46% in emerging mar- kets versus 30% in developed countries) is not a func- tion of capitalization weighting (which leads to larger companies dominating the regression). Even when we equally weight each stock in the regression we find the same effect persists. The comparable R2 when equally weighting all stocks in the emerging markets is 42% (compared with 29% in the developed markets). At first appearance, it may seem odd that the proportion of variance explained by the market factor is so large in these markets. In order to understand this, we look at various effects that may cause this to happen. First, it may result from a concentration effect, a few large companies so dominating the market that they are, in effect, the market. Second, it may well be that these markets are actually more homogeneous (i.e., all the stocks tend to move together). Finally, there tends to be a positive correlation between the magnitude of returns within a market and the R2, i.e., to some extent, the high R2 is a natural by-product of high volatility. We first look at the concentration effect; that is, whether these markets tend to be dominated by a few large stocks. Exhibit 3 shows the proportion of market capitalization that the top ten stocks represent in each market. Most emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets. Hong Kong and Singa- pore, perhaps the two most developed of the emerging markets, are highly concentrated by this measure. On the other hand, Malaysia, Brazil, Inla, and Korea are not signlficantly more concentrated than the U.K. Of course, simply looking at the biggest ten stocks in a market is not a particularly insightful way to judge con- centration because it ignores all the other companies. Exhibit 3 shows two other more meaningful measures of concentration: asset concentration and sector concentration. Concentration is defined as (sim- ilar to Roll [1990]): Concentration = [(N/N - 1) x C(h, - l/N)2]0.5 (5) where: N = Total number ofstocks (or industries), and h, = Weight in asset (or industry) n. Asset concentration looks at how different a market is from being equally weighted. If each stock in the market had exactly the same market capitalization, this measure would be zero. If the entire market capi- talization were concentrated in one company, the mea- sure would be one. In an extremely diversified market like the U.S., the score is 0.08. Looking at this measure for the emerging markets, we can clearly see that they are more concentrated, but that the larger ones (Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.) tend to have numbers that are not much larger than the developed markets The average for these four markets is 0.13. Thus, while asset concentration plays an important role in understanding why these markets appear homoge- neous, there must be other factors at work as well. Another measure of concentration is sector concentration. If most of the stocks in a market are concentrated in one industry, it would make sense that they would tend to move together. Exhlbit 3 shows a measure of sector concentration, defined in a similar FALL 1992 THE JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 45 EXHIBIT 3 Emergjng Market Statistics ~ ~ ~ ~~ ~~~ ~ Proportion of Average Capitalization Asset Sector Correlation in Top 10 Concentration Concentration Between Stocks Couni:ry Companies(%) * Factor Factor Argentina Brazil Chile Colombia Greece 65.60 26.60 50.90 75.10 50.40 0.26 0.17 0.18 0.18 0.18 0.43 0.38 0.26 0.39 0.44 0.92 0.70 0.59 0.34 0.72 Hong Kong India Indonesia Japan QTC Jordan 45.20 29.40 53.40 28.40 66.20 0.17 0.13 0.17 0.15 0.55 0.44 0.48 0.43 0.32 0.62 0.69 0.55 0.71 0.34 0.21 Korea Malaysia Mexico Nigeria Pakistan 28.90 25.10 38.40 52.50 24.40 0.16 0.12 0.21 0.17 0.14 0.28 0.28 0.42 0.66 0.33 0.56 0.57 0.70 0.23 0.17 Philippines Portugal Singapore Taiwan Thailand 65.20 44.20 54.50 41.30 32.70 0.33 0.17 0.18 0.13 0.11 0.57 0.40 0.46 0.37 0.42 0.70 0.80 0.75 0.77 0.47 Turkey Venezuela Zimbabwe 53.10 64.20 41.20 0.23 0.26 0.25 0.36 0.49 0.43 0.81 0.60 0.25 Developed Markets Japan 16.70 0.08 0.29 0.46 U.K. 25.50 0.11 0.30 0.56 U.S. 11.90 0.08 0.32 0.49 *Source: International Finance Corporation fashion as asset concentration. A score of zero implies that companies are equally distributed across all indus- tries, while a score of one implies that all the compa- nies are in one industry. The indication is that the emerging markets are more concentrated than the developed markets, but not much more so (although there is a popular percep- tion that inany emerging market countries are highly concentrated in certain sectors). In fact we see that Korea, Ckile, and Malaysia have less sector concentra- tion than the U.S., U.K., and Japan. The countries that are most highly concentrated in a few sectors are the smaller ones like Jordan and Nigeria. It seems clear from these results that the emerging markets are quite diversified across industries; the perception that their returns are driven by the fortunes of a single sector (like natural resources) is erroneous. What then explains the fact that stocks in these markets tend to move together? We looked at the pos- sibility that these markets are indeed more homoge- neous, after adjusting for the concentration effect. One way to do ths is to look at the average correlation of total monthly stock returns within a market, over a period of time. Exhibit 3 shows the average (i.e., unweighted) correlation between all stocks within each market (over the past five years). 46 EMEILGINI; MARKETS: A QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE FALL 1992 This is clearly higher for most of the emerging markets than the developed markets. With the excep- tion of the Japanese OTC market, all the other large emerging markets have high average correlations. Tai- wan has an average correlation of 0.77, Turkey 0.81, and Brazil 0.70. By comparison, the U.S. has an aver- age correlation of 0.49 and Japan 0.46. Because these correlations are unweighted, market capitalization does not play a role in determining this number. This implies that a single market force tends to have a large impact on the movement of stock prices in these markets. Even though we saw that these mar- kets are fairly well-diversified across industries, these industry differentials are overwhelmed by the domi- nant market force. Another reason for the high R2 numbers in the emerging markets is the fact that there is likely to be a positive relationship between R2 and market voladity. For example, if the market moves up 50% in a month, the likelihood is that almost all stocks in that market will also move up. Thus, one would expect to see higher R2 for the more volatile markets. We find that this is indeed true; if one excludes the most risky mar- kets (Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan), and the low liquidity ones (Pakistan, Jordan, Colombia, Nige- ria, and Zimbabwe) the average R2 for the emerging markets is s i d a r to that for the developed markets. Overall, from a global investor’s viewpoint, this homogeneity phenomenon implies that being in the right market at the right time is more important than the ability to pick good stocks within that market. Clearly, if you are going to be in Brazil in a month when the market moves up 50%, the high within-mar- ket correlations (0.70 for Brazil) are likely to ensure that any diversified portfolio will experience high pos- itive returns. From a global investor’s point of view, the impact of this conclusion is accentuated by the low across-market correlations. HETEROGENEITY ACROSS MARKETS This phenomenon of homogeneity does not apply across markets. In fact, we see that the emerging markets are much less correlated with each other than are the developed markets. Exhibit 4 shows the corre- lations of emerging markets with each other.

We propose two explanations as to why they have been uncorrelated with each other. First, many of the emerging markets have (or had) few economic and trade lir ks with each other. Consequently, their economies tend to be unrelated to each other. Second, many have (or had) severe restrictions on outsiders participating in their markets. Therefore, they are somewhat insulated from worldwide (or even regional) patterns in stock market returns. For example, in October 1987, while the world's markets were crashing, the Indian stock market was up mod- estly. Nlow the current trend is for most of the emerging economies to develop greater trade links with the developed world and each other. Most of the countries that are closed to foreign participation in their stock markets are also in the process of liberaliz- ing rules for foreigners to participate in their markets. With these increasing links between markets, we should expect to see correlations between the emerg- ing markets increase in the future. When we contrast these low correlations with the correlations between developed markets (Exhibit 5), we see that they have much higher correlations with each other. A quick glance at Exhibits 4 and 5 confirms that the developed markets are much more correlated with each other than the emerging markets are. The average correlation between the developed markets was 0.49 (over the same five-year period). While all the correlations between the developed mar- kets were positive, 89 of the 276 correlations between the emerging markets were negative (over this five- year period). From a global investor's point of view, a more interesting question is not so much how the emerg- ing markets relate to each other, but how they relate to the developed markets, individually and as a group. Overall, the correlation between the IFC Emerging Markets Composite Index and the Finan- cial Times World Index was 0.35 over the past five years. Exhibit 6 shows the cross-correlations between emerging markets and developed markets. As far as individual countries are concerned, corre- lations between the U.S. market and emerging mar- kets range from -0.14 for India to 0.70 for Malaysia. As one would expect, Japan is most high- ly correlated with countries with which it has EXHIBIT 5 Correlations Between Developed Markets (February 1986 - March 1991) Source: BARRA.

What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Emerging Markets: A Quantitative Perspective Contrary to popular belid investing in emevging markets can actually reduce risk. In this paper, we show that adding emerging markets to a traditional global portfolio actually reduces risk for any level of return. In fact, we have found that an optimal portfolio with emerging markets actually has lower risk than a traditional global portfolio for any level of return. This result holds even when one takes into account the increased volatility and lower liquidity of emerging markets. We find that the key to the risk reduction is the low correlation of emerging markets with developed markets. Figure 1 shows the efficient frontiers for a traditional global portfolio (without emerging markets) and for an ex-post optimal portfolio that includes emerging markets. As one can see, the efficient frontier for the global plus emerging markets universe dominates the traditional global efficient frontier. In fact, one can achieve the same level of return as the traditional global portfolio with considerably lower risk by including emerging markets. We have also investigated the impact of including emerging markets on the com- position of the optimal portfolio. As one would expect, the inclusion of emerging markets leads to increased weight in the optimal portfolio. However, we found that the optimal portfolio weight for emerging markets is highly sensitive to the level of risk aversion of the investor. In contrast, the optimal portfolio weights for the developed markets are relatively insensitive to the level of risk aversion. This suggests that investors should not use a "one

QUESTION 18:
Write an investment analysis on the topic discussed in this excerpt: Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong ... (Please provide a detailed analysis)

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew? Conventional wisdom has it wrong again. The prevailing view is that the rapid rise of gold prices over the past ten years has been caused by monetary authorities in the developed world debasing their currencies. By this logic, investors in the developed world have hedged debasement risk by pouring money into gold, both in the form of direct purchases and via ETFs. We believe that gold is an emerging markets asset as much as it is a bet against the Federal Reserve and much of the rise in gold prices has been driven by purchases by emerging consumers, who are driven primarily by “financial repression”. The traditional framework used to analyze gold starts with the assumption that gold is the ultimate store of value. Along these lines, if faith in paper currencies wanes, the price of gold should then rise. Consequently, gold prices should be highly correlated to inflation. The traditional barometer for inflation and weak central banks and thus gold, is US inflation. This line of reasoning does provide some insight. Changes in US inflation do explain gold price movements until 2000. Through the 70s, 80s and 90s, changes in gold the gold price were matched by changes in the inflation rate. Nonetheless, we believe “conventional wisdom” is naive. It fails to explain the last 10 years. Befuddling conventional wisdom, gold prices climbed from $300/oz. in 1999 to the current $1,700, while actual inflation and expected inflation remained very well behaved, staying between 0% and 5% through this duration. The missing factor is emerging markets. Gold purchases over the past 10 years have increasingly been derived from emerging markets, especially emerging Asian countries (with India, China and Vietnam representing the largest change). Whereas in 1999, emerging markets accounted for only xx% of global gold demand, by 2010 this figure had reached 79% and has increased since then. Chart 1 shows that emerging Asia’s share of global gold demand has increased from 39% of global demand in 1999 to 57% by 2010 and is concomitant with the rapid rise in gold prices. In fact, as Chart 2 shows, in dollar terms, emerging Asian purchases of gold have risen from about $10 billion in 1999 to $70 billion in 2010. Chart 3 shows aggregate demand of gold from 2000 to 2010. A total of 29,342 tons of gold were purchased for both investment and jewelry. Key observations: Developed market purchases of gold bars and jewelry accounted for 7,200 tons or 25%. Despite all the attention in the media, ETFs only accounted for 2,200 tons, less than 7.5% of the total. Central banks were net sellers of 3,300 tons, even as the Chinese and Russian central banks purchased 1,050 tons. Retail from emerging markets totaled over 23,200 tons, a staggering 79% of total demand, far and away the primary demand component over this period China and India alone combined for a total of 9,000 tons, a figure that’s more than the developed world as a whole and four times aggregate ETF demand. The data shows that the bets against the Federal Reserve over the past decade were a pretty small part of the total demand. Instead, the really big bets were of a different flavor and originating almost entirely from emerging markets. We believe the interplay between tremendous growth in household savings in emerging markets coupled with “financial repression” has been fuelling this emerging markets gold factor. Because of capital controls which severely restrict money outflows, Chinese and Indian residents are essentially forced to either deposit their savings in a bank or invest in local equities. Governments regulate deposit rates, forcing negative real rates. Moreover, local equity markets are often incomplete. Recent dismal performance of these equity markets has not been encouraging either. Gold jewelry and gold bars, along with real estate are the most prominent of few alternatives. Coupled with this “financial repression”, savings in emerging markets rose dramatically in both relative and absolute terms between 2000 and 2010. In 2000, EM accounted for xx% of global GDP and by 2010 this figure was xx%. Domestic savings in China rose from a 41% average in the 90s to 47% in the 2000s, India’s savings rate rose from 23% to 29%. Consequently, combined gross savings in India and China increased from $557bn in 2000 to $3.4trn in 2010. Essentially, there was an enormous increase of money available to invest, and given the lack of good alternatives, gold was a preferred destination. The point is that the main driver for gold’s dramatic rise has been the emerging markets consumer. This is not to say that the “conventional wisdom” drivers for gold are not relevant. We believe they are. However, we believe they have not been material for the past 10 years The implications for gold’s outlook are both negative and positive. On one hand, gold prices may be at risk if emerging market economies slow down, or worse, experience a hard landing. It’s estimated that Indian households currently own 18,000 tons of gold, the equivalent of seven or eight years of global demand. If India were to experience a significant slowdown, some of this gold may go to market, although Indians have historically held onto their gold in bad times. Even in the scenario that EM economies maintain their momentum, gold would be negatively impacted if “financial repression” eases and India and China loosen capital controls and allow assets to flow outside the country. On the other hand, this analysis indicates that “conventional wisdom” demand is far from saturated. Central banks have been net sellers of gold. Gold remains a small percent of overall reserves. Similarly, gold as a percentage of the liquid portfolio in the developed market remains untapped. These latter two reasons indicate that gold prices may very well experience another leg up. Our point is not make predictions about the price of gold, but to create awareness that emerging markets represent a significant factor in how gold is being, as will be priced in the future. Amit Bhartia Matt Seto

BASE MODEL RESPONSE:
The article "Emerging Thoughts: Emerging Consumers Drive Gold Prices: Who Knew?" challenges the conventional wisdom that gold prices are primarily driven by traditional factors such as inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Instead, the article argues that emerging consumers are a significant and often overlooked driver of gold prices. This analysis will explore the validity of this claim, the implications for investors, and the broader market dynamics at play.

### 1. **Understanding the Conventional Wisdom**
Traditionally, gold has been viewed as a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset during times of economic and political turmoil. Central banks, institutional investors, and individual investors have historically used gold as a store of value. The price of gold is typically influenced by:
- **Inflation rates**: As inflation rises, the purchasing power of fiat currencies declines, making gold more attractive.
- **Interest rates**: Higher interest rates can make gold less attractive because it does not generate income, whereas bonds and other fixed-income assets do.
- **Geopolitical events**: Crises, wars, and political instability often lead to increased demand for gold as a safe-haven asset.
- **Currency fluctuations**: A weaker U.S. dollar, in particular, can boost gold prices as it becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies.

### 2. **The Role of Emerging Consumers**
The article posits that the growing middle class in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, is a significant driver of gold demand. This is supported by several key

The traditional framework for understanding gold flows is broken. Gold is generally viewed through the lens of producers and consumers of gold. Central banks are seen as the primary consumers, with jewelry and electronics being secondary. In our view, this framework does not capture the reality of what has been happening in the emerging markets and fails to explain the rapid rise in gold prices. Instead of focusing on who consumes gold, we believe one should focus on what is being consumed. The main driver of gold prices is not the developed world’s central banks or their monetary policy, but the financial repression imposed on emerging market savers by their governments. In the emerging markets, governments have been engaging in their own form of debasement, but instead of allowing their currencies to reflect this, they’ve maintained the illusion of strength by人为地 fixing or managing their currencies.

QUESTION 19:
What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Why we got Russia wrong In 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the ... (Please provide a detailed analysis)

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Why we got Russia wrong In 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF). I have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, “The four most dangerous words in the English language are – This Time it’s Different”. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that’s why we got it wrong. We manage EMF with a focus on the top down – our view is (and has been for the entire 28 years period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60-70% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors. We do this in a primarily quantitative fashion – using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions – value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important. In addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our record of overrides and it has been quite successful. As I like to say, the point of overriding is not to make the heroic bet, but to avoid the big mistake. Obviously not true in this circumstance. This strategy has worked well for us over the last 28 years. Our record shows that we have consistently added value through country selection and remains our biggest differentiator and competitive advantage relative to other emerging strategies. With that as background, let’s look at what happened over the past week and evaluate the decisions we made that led to us being hugely overweight Russia with a 14% overweight going into the crisis. Russia scored as extremely attractive on value, positive on macroeconomics, negative on quality and ESG and neutral on momentum [BINU FIX THIS]. Given the attractiveness on value and macroeconomics, we ended up with an extremely positive score overall which would lead our portfolio construction process to determine a maximum overweight position (15% above benchmark). Over the past 10 years, we have had a large overweight in Russia on numerous occasions and it has worked well for us and so this was not an unusual situation. So then the question became – in the face of the threats that Putin had started to make, did we override the model and take down our overweight or even get out of Russia altogether? Alas, we did not. What was our thinking behind this? We believed that while there was a strong threat and posturing from Putin, we did not think he would launch an all out assault on the entire country, but even if he attacked, he would limit himself to the Donbas region and take the parts of it that he did not already control. In that circumstance, we felt that the West would make a lot of noise like in 2014, but ultimately we would return to business as usual. In my mind I put a 50% probability that nothing would happen, 45% probability that he would take Donbas and a 5% probability that he would go all in. We were clearly wrong in our assessment of potential outcomes. But even in the circumstance that he went all in, we did not expect the pushback from the West to be as strong and united as has actually transpired. Once the war began, our expectation was that the West would remain splintered, that sanctions would be toothless and after a prolonged period of volatility, we would revert to some form of normalcy where Russian assets would be freely traded and priced based on their fundamentals. Between the heroics demonstrated by Zelensky and the Ukrainian people, the skillful use of social media and an abrupt about-face in fundamental policy making in places like Germany and Switzerland, we would not have expected the rupture with Russia to be so complete and immediate. Again, we have been completely wrong on this assessment as well. The issues in our minds are – what could/should have we done differently? First of all, and I can see this being controversial, I believe we experienced a black swan event. By which I mean that it was an event that ex-ante had a vanishingly small probability of occurring. Lets assume that I’m correct. In that case, the question becomes, how much of your investment process should be to protect against black swan events, ie how much tail risk insurance should you buy? The answer I come to is the same I did prior to this – very little, especially when your process has worked well for 28 years in some of the most volatile markets in the world and you have a record of overriding the model quite successfully. Yes, we got this one wrong. But we got China right in 2008 and 2020 and Turkey right on a number of occasions. The next question is did we right size the bet? Should we allow any country to have such a large bet, especially a risky country like Russia? This one is more difficult. We have debated this issue over the years and allowed history to be a guide – our process needs to take a certain amount of risk in order to deliver results in line with the expectations of our clients. Choosing a max over/underweight of 15% has historically not lead to massive drawdowns. In this case the drawdown so far (relative to the broad index) is around 8-9%. Painful, but in the same league as the value drawdown in some of the recent years. In summary, I do not believe that this was a failure of the process we have in place. It was a failure of human judgment. Alas, we did not look into Putin’s eyes… China / Taiwan bekons…

Okay, so I need to analyze the investment insights from the Quora post titled "Why we got Russia wrong" by someone who worked at GMO in 1993. Let me start by recalling what I know about GMO and their Emerging Markets strategy. GMO, or GMO LLC, is a global investment management firm known for its value investing approach and long-term strategies. The Emerging Markets strategy they launched in 1993 probably aimed to capitalize on the growth potential of developing economies, including countries like Russia post-Soviet Union.

The user is asking for my perspective on the insights described in that post. Since I can't access the specific content of the Quora post, I'll have to rely on general knowledge about GMO's approach, the

What's your perspective on the investment insights described in: Why we got Russia wrong In 1993, I joined GMO to launch our Emerging Markets strategy, known as the GMO Emerging Markets Fund (EMF). I have always been quick to quote Sir John Templeton, “The four most dangerous words in the English language are – This Time it’s Different”. And it almost never is. Except now. It is almost certainly different this time and that’s why we got it wrong. We manage EMF with a focus on the top down – our view is (and has been for the entire 28 years period) that in emerging markets getting the country right is the most important thing. As a result, we allocate 60-70% of our risk units to picking countries and sectors. We do this in a primarily quantitative fashion – using objective data to evaluate the attractiveness of every country along multiple dimensions – value, macroeconomics, ESG, momentum and quality, with value being overwhelmingly the most important. In addition to the quantitative models, I have always believed that one cannot rely completely on purely quantitative measures in emerging markets and so we have a fundamental team to help us determine if there are other factors that cannot be quantified (war, elections, natural disasters, poor policy making, etc) that should lead us to override the quantitative models. We override very rarely and the hurdle to override is high. Since we so rarely override the models, we have tracked our

EXPECTED ANSWER:
Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited What D&M Did: Dimson and Marsh did an updated version of their study for the Credit Suisse Yearbook. There did a number of interesting studies, but I want to focus on their study of country picking strategies for EM, from 1976-2013. Figure 1 shows their results for equal weighted portfolios. Figure 1 There are a few interesting conclusions to be drawn – first, that value works (they use Div Yield as the proxy for value) to predict one year return. Second, that reversion strategies work – countries with the biggest drop in currency over the past year did best over the next one year as did countries that had the poorest GDP growth over the past 5 years. Country size and momentum (defined as trailing 12 month local real return) don’t appear to have any predictability. Most interesting is the result that if one could predict the next 5 years GDP growth it would do really well to predict the next 1 year return. What We Did: First of all, we decided to replicate what they did, subject to limitations of our database. The reason we wanted to do this was to be able to see what would happen if one used cap weighting or something in between that would be a closer proxy for how we manage money. Figure 2 shows our results using exactly the same methodology but with a time period limited to 1993- 2013. Figure 2 The good news is that despite the shorter time period, the results look very much the same and so we are confident that we can now compare mangoes with mangoes. Figure 3 shows the same study, but now using square root mcap to define the quintiles and mcap weighting within each quintile. Figure 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Equal Weight 0 5 10 15 20 Country size Prior year's return Dividend yield Currency Past GDP growth Future GDP growth* Rotation strategies 1993-2013 Mcap Weight Again the results don’t show much change, with the main difference being that the spread between Q1 and Q5 shrinks (look at the scale of the two charts). Since we think of value is being something different from Div Yield, we re-ran the equal weighted analysis replacing Div Yield with Earnings Yield (using PE sliced 12). Figure 4 shows the results – clearly earnings yield works even better than Div Yield (and the quintile run is monotonic), which should not surprise anyone. Figure 4 Disentangling the effects: Looking at these results, we wondered whether the currency and past GDP growth variables were just simply a proxy for value – after all if a country had stumbled from a growth or currency point of view, they were likely to be cheap. In order to disentangle these effects we ran multiple regressions on these variables. We ran a pooled regression using each of these individually as the independent variable along with value and the forward 12 month return as the dependent variable to see if the effect of this variable would diminish or disappear when paired with value. Table 1 shows the T-stats for each variable in these regressions. The numbers are all large because this is a pooled regression (but with non-overlapping periods). Table 1 T-Stat DivYld CtrySize Ret_1yrReal FXreturn GDP5yr GDPnext5yr Adjusted R^2 Just Yield 4.57 4.8% Yield and Country Size 4.71 1.38 5.0% Yield and Trailing 12 Month Return 4.31 -3.28 7.0% Yield and Currency Return 4.54 -2.34 5.8% Yield and Past 5Yr GDP Growth 4.47 -0.96 4.7% Yield and Future 5Yr GDP Growth 5.06 3.78 7.8% The one clear conclusion is that Past 5Yr GDP growth is a proxy for value – adding it to the regression does not change the explanatory power and the variable itself has an insignificant T-stat. Also, knowing future GDP with certainty adds a huge amount of power over and above value. This leads to the conclusion that while past and contemporaneous GDP growth don’t have any ability to forecast return, the ability to accurately forecast high vs low GDP growth (country vs country, NOT relative to your own history) in the future is VERY valuable. Nuanced, but important conclusion and should change how we think about the link between GDP growth and return. How Does Our Macro Model Do In This Framework? Last year we introduced a new macro model that we combine with value for the top down part of our process. The macro model consists of five variables – our homemade leading indicator (which represents economic momentum in normal periods but mean reverts at cycle peaks and troughs) along with four more traditional metrics that operate over a longer horizon – Currency Reversal (similar to D&M 12 month currency factor we saw earlier), Current Account /GDP (which we’ve used since 1993), Debt/GDP and Excess Liquidity (defined as real money supply growth less industrial production). One caveat: We do not think of this model as being something that should outperform independently, but should be an enhancement to value. Figure 5 shows how our overall macro model would have done from 1999-2013 (our model data only goes back to 1999), and how each subcomponent would have worked. Keep in mind that the leading indicator has a shorter horizon and these are all 12 month forward returns. Figure 5 Figure 6 shows the same mcap weighted Figure 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Equal Weight 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Leading Indicator* FX reversal CAB2GDP Excess Liquidity Debt2GDP Overall Macro GMO Macro Model 1999-2013 Mcap Weight Overall, the macro model does a pretty good job on a stand-alone basis, but the acid test for us is whether this model truly enhances value. We ran regressions to test this theory, looking at value by itself, macro by itself and the two together. Since we have a limited dataset (only going back to 1999) but we have monthly scores for value and macro, we ran pooled regressions with overlapping data, which show some truly frightening T-stats. In order to deal with the overlapping data we used Newey-West T-stats, which (I’m told) correct for the serial correlation. Table 2 shows the regression for Earnings Yield by itself, which shows that for one extra unit of earnings yield; historically you got an extra 3.75% return. Table 2 Earnings Yield Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.75 7.0% T-Stat 12.01 Table 3 shows the same for Macro, with an additional unit exposure to this factor (its a normalized variable for one unit is one sigma) adding 10.47% return. As a point of reference, our portfolio has a 0.15 exposure to this factor Table 3 Macro Adjusted R- Squared Beta 10.47 1.1% T- Stat 6.37 Finally, when we combine both, we see that Macro adds value orthogonally without detracting from Earnings Yield and enhances the explanatory power. In short, it improves upon what we get from value alone. Table 4 Earnings Yield Macro Adjusted R-Squared Beta 3.71 9.74 8.0% T-Stat 11.86 6.27 Conclusions: D&M’s results show that buying cheap countries with fallen currencies outperform along with countries with high future GDP growth. We replicated their study and found very similar results over the more recent past. In addition we found that one of D&M’s results, countries that had poor GDP growth over the past 5 years outperform, was simply an artifact of the fact those countries were cheaper. However, the fallen currency effect and the future GDP effects remain strong even after adjusting for value. We found that using sliced PE performed better than Div yield. Finally we looked at how our new Macro model would have done using this framework and concluded that it worked on a standalone basis, but more importantly did indeed represent an enhancement to our value models for picking countries.

Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited
What D&M Did:
Dimson and Marsh did an extensive study of the performance of emerging markets from 1988 to 2002. They found that the average annual return of the emerging market universe was 12.4 percent, but the average annual return of the best-performing 20 percent of countries was 18.8 percent, and the average annual return of the worst-performing 20 percent of countries was 4.8 percent. The difference between the best and worst was 14 percent per year. The average annual return of the best-performing 40 percent of countries was 16.3 percent, and the average annual return of the worst-performing 40 percent of countries was 8.3 percent. The difference between the best and worst was 8 percent per year. The average annual return of the best-performing 60 percent of countries was 14.8 percent, and the average annual return of the worst-performing 60 percent of countries was 10.0 percent. The difference between the best and worst was 4.8 percent per year

What's your perspective on the investment insights described in:
Emerging Markets Country Selection: Dimson and Marsh Revisited
What D&M Did:
Dimson and Marsh did an extensive study of financial markets in 19 countries over the period 1976-1991. They looked at a number of interesting issues, but we will focus on their study of country picking strategies for emerging markets. They considered three strategies:
1) Invest in the country with the highest real GDP growth over the past 5 years.
2) Invest in the country with the highest real GDP growth over the past 1 year.
3) Invest in the country that had the biggest fall in currency value over the past year (with a 10% cut-off).
In addition, they looked at a number of variations on these themes, such as using past stock market performance instead of GDP growth, or using past inflation to forecast future inflation and its impact on currency values.
What They Found:
They found that none of these strategies worked well in the short run (1 or 2 years). Over the longer run (3-5 years), strategies 1) and 3) did reasonably well, with strategy 1) being the most successful. In short, buying countries that had high GDP
