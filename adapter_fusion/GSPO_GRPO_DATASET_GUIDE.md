# Creating Datasets for GRPO/GSPO/Dr. GRPO Training

## 📁 Your Current Data

**Location:** `/Users/macbook2024/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/AAA Backup/A Working/Arjun LLM Writing/Writing/`

**Existing Files:**
- `writing_dataset_train.jsonl` - 17 examples
- `writing_dataset_valid.jsonl` - validation set
- Multiple PDF/DOCX documents with your writing

**Current Format:** Messages format (user/assistant pairs) - ✅ Works for SFT

---

## 🎯 THE CORRECT FORMAT (All GRPO Methods)

**IMPORTANT:** GSPO, Dr. GRPO, and GRPO all use the **SAME simple format**:

```jsonl
{"prompt": "Your question or instruction", "answer": "The reference response", "system": "Optional system message"}
```

**That's it!** No preference pairs, no rankings, no multiple completions needed.

### **Why This Format?**

GRPO-based methods work by:
1. Taking your prompt
2. **Generating** multiple completions (done automatically by the training algorithm)
3. Comparing them to your reference answer
4. Learning which completions are better

**You only provide:**
- The prompt (question/instruction)
- The reference answer (your ideal response)
- Optional system message (to set behavior)

---

## ✅ Converting Your Existing Data

### **From Messages Format:**

**Your current format (SFT):**
```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the paradox of growth"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The paradox is..."}]}
```

**Convert to GRPO format:**
```json
{"prompt": "Explain the paradox of growth", "answer": "The paradox is...", "system": "You are an expert on emerging markets investing."}
```

### **Conversion Script:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Convert your existing SFT data to GRPO format"""

import json

def convert_messages_to_grpo(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f_in, open(output_file, 'w') as f_out:
        for line in f_in:
            data = json.loads(line)
            messages = data.get('messages', [])

            # Extract user message (prompt) and assistant message (answer)
            prompt = ""
            answer = ""
            system = "You are an expert investment writer specializing in emerging markets."

            for msg in messages:
                if msg['role'] == 'system':
                    system = msg['content']
                elif msg['role'] == 'user':
                    prompt = msg['content']
                elif msg['role'] == 'assistant':
                    answer = msg['content']

            if prompt and answer:
                grpo_data = {
                    "prompt": prompt,
                    "answer": answer,
                    "system": system
                }
                f_out.write(json.dumps(grpo_data) + '\n')

# Convert your files
convert_messages_to_grpo('writing_dataset_train.jsonl', 'grpo_train.jsonl')
convert_messages_to_grpo('writing_dataset_valid.jsonl', 'grpo_valid.jsonl')
```

## 📝 Creating New GRPO Data

### **Template:**

```python
{
    "prompt": "What is the paradox of growth in emerging markets?",
    "answer": "The paradox of growth is that you invest in emerging markets for their growth, but you don't make money in the fast-growing places. You make money in the cheapest places. Our data from 2008-2018 shows the cheapest countries returned 19.9% annually vs 14.9% for the most expensive countries.",
    "system": "You are an expert investment writer specializing in emerging markets and value investing."
}
```

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Prompts**: Clear questions or instructions
   - "Explain the paradox of growth in emerging markets"
   - "What are the risks of value investing?"
   - "How should investors combine value and momentum?"

2. **Answers**: Your writing style - detailed, data-driven, nuanced
   - Include specific examples
   - Reference data when possible
   - Maintain your voice and tone
   - Show nuanced thinking

3. **System**: Optional but helpful for consistency
   - "You are an expert on emerging markets investing."
   - "You are a financial writer with 20+ years of experience."
   - Can be the same across all examples

## 🔄 What Each Method Does

### **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
**Your data:** `{"prompt": "...", "answer": "...", "system": "..."}`

**What happens during training:**
1. Takes your prompt
2. Generates 4 completions (default `group_size=4`)
3. Compares them to your reference answer
4. Learns to generate responses more like your answer

**Use when:** You want to improve overall writing quality and reasoning

### **GSPO (Group Sparse Policy Optimization)**
**Your data:** Same format - `{"prompt": "...", "answer": "...", "system": "..."}`

**What happens during training:**
1. Same as GRPO
2. **Plus**: Uses importance sampling to focus on more informative tokens/sequences

**Use when:** You want faster convergence or have limited training data

### **Dr. GRPO (Decoupled Rewards GRPO)**
**Your data:** Same format - `{"prompt": "...", "answer": "...", "system": "..."}`

**What happens during training:**
1. Same as GRPO
2. **Plus**: Separates reward computation for more stable training

**Use when:** GRPO training is unstable or you're using larger models

## 🚀 Quick Start: Convert Your Data

### **Step 1: Prepare Directory Structure**

```bash
mkdir -p my_grpo_data
cd my_grpo_data
```

### **Step 2: Create Training Data**

**From your existing writing**, create examples like:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json

examples = [
    {
        "prompt": "Explain the paradox of growth in emerging markets",
        "answer": "The paradox of growth is that you invest in emerging markets for their growth, but you don't make money in the fast-growing places. You make money in the cheapest places. Our data from 2008-2018 shows the cheapest countries returned 19.9% annually vs 14.9% for the most expensive countries.",
        "system": "You are an expert investment writer specializing in emerging markets."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the main problems with value investing?",
        "answer": "There are two main problems with buying Value: 1) You get caught in value traps, and 2) You get in and out too early. Combining value with quality and momentum sets guardrails that help avoid these problems.",
        "system": "You are an expert investment writer specializing in emerging markets."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Should investors pay up for growth stocks?",
        "answer": "It's not always a mistake to pay up for growth - it's only mostly a mistake. When Microsoft went public in 1986 at 20x earnings vs 14x for the S&P 500, buying and holding would have delivered 25% annually vs 8.75% for the S&P 500. The key is identifying exceptional growth at reasonable valuations.",
        "system": "You are an expert investment writer specializing in emerging markets."
    },
    # Add 15-20 more examples from your documents...
]

# Save training data
with open('train.jsonl', 'w') as f:
    for ex in examples:
        f.write(json.dumps(ex) + '\n')

# Create validation data (10-20% of training size)
validation_examples = [
    {
        "prompt": "What lessons came from the Asia Crisis?",
        "answer": "The Asia Crisis taught us that...",
        "system": "You are an expert investment writer specializing in emerging markets."
    },
    # 2-3 more validation examples
]

with open('valid.jsonl', 'w') as f:
    for ex in validation_examples:
        f.write(json.dumps(ex) + '\n')

print(f"Created {len(examples)} training examples")
print(f"Created {len(validation_examples)} validation examples")
```

### **Step 3: Validate Format**

Use the Enhanced Setup page's validation feature to check your data before training.

## 📞 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need preference pairs (chosen/rejected)?
**A: No!** That's for DPO. GRPO only needs `prompt/answer/system`.

### Q: Do I need to rank multiple responses?
**A: No!** The algorithm generates and ranks them during training.

### Q: What's the difference between GSPO and GRPO data?
**A: None!** Same format. GSPO just adds importance sampling during training.

### Q: Can I use my existing SFT data?
**A: Yes!** Just convert from messages format to prompt/answer/system format.

### Q: How many examples do I really need?
**A: Start with 20, aim for 50+.** Quality matters more than quantity.
