# Creating Datasets for GSPO and GRPO Training

## üìÅ Your Current Data

**Location:** `/Users/macbook2024/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/AAA Backup/A Working/Arjun LLM Writing/Writing/`

**Existing Files:**
- `writing_dataset_train.jsonl` - 17 examples
- `writing_dataset_valid.jsonl` - validation set
- Multiple PDF/DOCX documents with your writing

**Current Format:** Messages format (user/assistant pairs)

---

## üéØ Dataset Requirements by Method

### **SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** ‚úÖ You have this!
**What it needs:** Input-output pairs

**Your current format works:**
```jsonl
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "..."}]}
```

**Use for:** Teaching the model your writing style, tone, and domain knowledge

---

### **GSPO (Gradient-based Sparse Policy Optimization)**
**What it needs:** Preference pairs (chosen vs rejected responses)

**Format:**
```jsonl
{
  "prompt": "Explain the paradox of growth in emerging markets",
  "chosen": "The paradox of growth is that you invest in emerging markets for their growth, but you don't make money in the fast-growing places. You make money in the cheapest places. Our data shows that from 2008-2018, the cheapest countries returned 19.9% annually vs 14.9% for the most expensive.",
  "rejected": "Emerging markets grow fast so you should invest in the fastest growing countries to make the most money."
}
```

**Why GSPO:**
- 2x faster than standard RLHF
- Better for style/quality preferences
- Good for your writing: formal vs casual, detailed vs concise

---

### **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
**What it needs:** Multiple ranked responses per prompt

**Format:**
```jsonl
{
  "prompt": "What are the risks of value investing?",
  "completions": [
    {"text": "There are two main problems with buying Value: 1) You get caught in value traps, 2) You get in and out too early. Combining value with quality and momentum sets guardrails that help avoid these problems.", "score": 1.0},
    {"text": "Value investing has risks like value traps and timing issues.", "score": 0.5},
    {"text": "Value stocks are cheap for a reason and often stay cheap.", "score": 0.2}
  ]
}
```

**Why GRPO:**
- Best for reasoning tasks
- Handles multiple quality levels
- Good for your writing: nuanced investment analysis

---

### **Dr. GRPO (Domain-Refined GRPO)**
**What it needs:** Same as GRPO but with domain-specific examples

**Format:** Same as GRPO but focused on your domain (emerging markets, value investing)

**Why Dr. GRPO:**
- Specialized for your investment domain
- Better retention of domain knowledge
- Ideal for technical/professional writing

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Create These Datasets

### **Option 1: From Your Existing Writing (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1: Extract Key Insights**
From your PDFs/DOCX, extract:
- Main arguments
- Investment principles
- Market observations
- Data-backed conclusions

#### **Step 2: Create Prompt-Response Pairs**

**Good prompts from your writing:**
```
- "Explain the paradox of growth in emerging markets"
- "Why don't fast-growing countries always deliver the best returns?"
- "How should value and momentum be combined?"
- "What lessons can we learn from the Asia Crisis?"
- "Why did we get Russia wrong?"
```

#### **Step 3: Generate Multiple Responses**

**For each prompt, create 3 versions:**
1. **Best** (your actual writing style - detailed, data-driven)
2. **Good** (correct but less detailed)
3. **Poor** (oversimplified or wrong)

---

### **Option 2: Use Claude/GPT to Generate Variations**

**Script to create GSPO dataset:**

```python
import anthropic
import json

client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key="your-key")

# Your original writing samples
original_text = """
The paradox of growth is that you invest in emerging markets 
for their growth, but you don't make money in the fast-growing 
places. You make money in the cheapest places. Our data shows...
"""

prompt = f"""
Given this expert writing sample:
{original_text}

Create 3 versions:
1. BEST: Keep the original style (detailed, data-driven, nuanced)
2. GOOD: Correct but less detailed
3. POOR: Oversimplified or missing key insights

Format as JSON with prompt, chosen (best), rejected (poor)
"""

# Generate variations
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    max_tokens=2000,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)

# Save to JSONL
```

---

### **Option 3: Manual Curation (Highest Quality)**

**Process:**
1. Read through your documents
2. Identify 20-30 key insights
3. For each insight:
   - Write the prompt (question)
   - Write 3 responses (best, good, poor)
   - Rank them

**Example from your "Life Lessons" document:**

```jsonl
{
  "prompt": "What's the key to successful value investing in emerging markets?",
  "completions": [
    {
      "text": "Not everything that is cheap is Value. Some of it is Junk. While you occasionally make money buying Junk (like Q2 2009 when Russell 2000 was up 113%), it doesn't work in the long run. The solution is combining value with quality and momentum to set guardrails that help avoid value traps and prevent getting in and out too early.",
      "score": 1.0
    },
    {
      "text": "Combine value investing with quality and momentum indicators to avoid value traps.",
      "score": 0.6
    },
    {
      "text": "Buy cheap stocks and hold them.",
      "score": 0.2
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìä Recommended Dataset Sizes

### **For Your Use Case (Writing Style + Domain Knowledge):**

| Method | Min Examples | Recommended | Ideal |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **SFT** | 10 | 20-50 | 100+ |
| **GSPO** | 20 | 50-100 | 200+ |
| **GRPO** | 30 | 100-200 | 500+ |
| **Dr. GRPO** | 20 | 50-100 | 200+ |

**Your current 17 examples:** Good start for SFT, need more for GSPO/GRPO

## üöÄ Quick Start: Create Your First GSPO Dataset

### **Script: `create_gspo_dataset.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Create GSPO dataset from your writing samples.
"""

import json
from pathlib import Path

# Your key insights (manually extracted)
insights = [
    {
        "prompt": "Explain the paradox of growth in emerging markets",
        "chosen": "The paradox of growth is that you invest in emerging markets for their growth, but you don't make money in the fast-growing places. You make money in the cheapest places. Our data from 2008-2018 shows the cheapest countries returned 19.9% annually vs 14.9% for the most expensive countries.",
        "rejected": "Emerging markets grow fast, so invest in the fastest growing ones to make the most money."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What are the main problems with value investing?",
        "chosen": "There are two main problems with buying Value: 1) You get caught in value traps, and 2) You get in and out too early. Combining value with quality and momentum sets guardrails that help avoid these problems.",
        "rejected": "Value investing is risky because cheap stocks often stay cheap."
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Should you pay up for growth stocks?",
        "chosen": "It's not always a mistake to pay up for growth - it's only mostly a mistake. When Microsoft went public in 1986, I didn't buy it because it was trading at 20x earnings vs 14x for the S&P500. If I had bought and held till today, it would have delivered 25% annually vs 8.75% for the S&P 500. The key is identifying exceptional growth at reasonable valuations.",
        "rejected": "Never pay up for growth stocks - they're always overvalued."
    },
    # Add 17-47 more examples...
]

# Save as JSONL
output_file = "gspo_writing_dataset.jsonl"
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    for item in insights:
        f.write(json.dumps(item) + '\n')

print(f"Created {len(insights)} GSPO examples in {output_file}")
```
