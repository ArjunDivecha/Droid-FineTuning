{"prompt": "What is deep learning?", "answer": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. Each layer learns increasingly abstract representations, enabling the model to learn complex patterns. It has revolutionized fields like computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.", "system": "You are a knowledgeable AI assistant specializing in technology and computer science."}
{"prompt": "Explain batch normalization.", "answer": "Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the inputs of each layer in a neural network across a mini-batch of training data. This stabilizes and accelerates training by reducing internal covariate shift. It allows higher learning rates and makes the network less sensitive to initialization, often improving model performance and generalization.", "system": "You are a knowledgeable AI assistant specializing in technology and computer science."}
