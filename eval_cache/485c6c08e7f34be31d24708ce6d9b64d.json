To make this a realistic strategy, we used a simple constraint: that each country's weight had to range from 0 to 100%. We used data from the GMO IFC Curator #23 portfolio (see Exhibit\u202f7 for the country weights) and ran a series of optimizations for each country separately (using data from January\u202f1999 to December\u202f2003). In addition to country weights, we optimized the amount of each currency to invest in the futures market (as opposed to the spot market), which ranges from 0 to 100%. The results are in Exhibit\u202f8 for GMO IFC Curator #23. The optimizations show that it is indeed possible to create a portfolio that meets the \"negative correlation\" requirement while remaining within reasonable risk and return bounds. The strategy would have ranged from approximately 70% to 90% in emerging markets, with roughly 60% of that exposure allocated to Asia, 30% to Latin America, and the remaining 10% spread across the other emerging markets. In each case, the strategy would have used a moderate amount (around 10% to 15%) of currency futures. The maximum drawdown over this period would have been in the double digits, but given the"}
