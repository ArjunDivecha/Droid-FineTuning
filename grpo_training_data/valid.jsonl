In both cases the bubble was caused by overcapacity financed with “cheap” capital, overvalued markets encouraged by accommodating central bankers and overpriced currencies driven by massive foreign direct and portfolio investment. \n\nWhile the Asia crisis has largely played out, we are in the early stages of the unraveling of the U.S. bubble. This “Emerging Thoughts” piece focuses on lessons we learned from living through the Asia crisis and it’s aftermath in the hope that it may provide insights to U.S. investors facing a similar situation.\n\nLesson xx: How much a market has fallen does not give you a clue as to much further it could fall. To wit; \n\n“Q: How does one characterize a market that has fallen 90%?”\n“A: It first fell 80% and then halved.”\n\nIn short, the fact that the NASDAQ has fallen 75% from it’s peak doesn’t mean it’s a good buy.\n\nLesson xx: Where has the big money been made post crisis? Market leaders that gained a competitive advantage by their weaker rivals going out of business. Land and House example, Shinsegae example\n\nLesson xx: People focus on yesterday’s news ( accounting etc.)  but market/regulators force changes in management/practices. Thus focus less on management but on fundamental assets/ competitive advantages of the business. \n\nLesson xx: Catching a falling safe\n\nLesson xx: Markets can stagnate for a long time. Despite getting it right, Thai market is still stuck in a trading band which is 80% below peak levels. Confidence takes along time to come back.\n\nLesson xx: Have seen large bear market rallies.
